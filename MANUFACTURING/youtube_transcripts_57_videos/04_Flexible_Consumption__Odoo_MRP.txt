it's common to consume more or fewer
components than what is defined on the
bill of materials now this kind of
flexible consumption is prevalent in
Industries such as food and beverage
where usage depends on a variety of
factors now let's say you're making a
fruit salad recipe calls for one cup of
apples if the apples you receive are
half the size this week you're going to
need twice as many to get that one cup
or maybe you've run out of apples now
you're using pears for a weird salad
odo's flexible consumption feature
allows us to keep track of any
modifications we make to a product
during its manufacturing process thereby
keeping product and component counts
accurate in our inventory and during
production ODU even permits flexible
consumption for subcontracted production
now to learn more about subcontracting
be sure to check out the tutorials
related to that now at stealthy wood our
Flagship showroom has its own Cafe where
we make wholesome treats that are
visiting customers can purchase our most
popular is a cheese souffle so let's
take a look and see how we can use
flexible consumption in odoo to make
that are the doors so here we are in the
manufacturing application now first we
need to enable flexible consumption
which is done on the bill of materials
itself so we're gonna go up here to our
products build materials and now we'll
be preparing our popular cheese souffle
so we gotta find that and open it up all
right there we go all right now the
recipe is pretty simple heavy cream eggs
parmesan cheese if we go check the
operations tab you'll notice we just
have one operation it's a mix and bake
now when we head over over here to the
miscellaneous tab you'll notice a few
other things now you'll see that there
are three options for flexible
consumption now we have a loud allowed
with warning and blocked now the allowed
option is appropriate for frequent
flexible consumption as it lets you
freely consume any amount of components
without restriction I don't like
restrictions myself and we also have a
loud with warning and that's an option
that allows flexible consumption but
provides a notification to review before
closing the manufacturing order and
finally we have blocked and that is an
option that depending on the user's
access rights may or may not be allowed
to close the actual manufacturing order
when modifications to consumption are
made that's the war on us against Steve
now for the first part of the demo I'm
going to use the allowed with warning
because I just need a little warning and
later on we're going to go over blocked
over here now flexible consumption is
going to be something that I love a lot
actually and you'll see why now to
illustrate how to use flexible
consumption let's create a manufacturing
order so we're going to go up here to
operations manufacturing orders new one
and what is our product well we've been
talking about cheese souffles
so that's what we'll make all right
everything looks good to go let's
confirm this and let's jump on over here
to our work orders and we're going to go
into tablet view just to show you how
this looks like to a chef alrighty to do
so here we are inside of our tablet mode
because that's what an employee would
see now odoo shows us up at the top how
much we're going to be making in this
case we're going to be making a dozen of
these souffles now over here on our left
hand side we have our consumption our
basically ingredients that we need to
validate the consumption of now starting
with heavy cream we basically used a bit
too much we had to make these Peaks
perfect though so we're going to
validate that and for the next one our
eggs were really huge so we didn't need
as many 23 instead of 24. and you'll
notice when I did that the validation
button changed from highlight over here
to the continue production instead now
in our case though we are certain that
we use 23 out of 24 eggs so we can
actually still hit validate and move on
and finally our parmesan cheese were
perfect now so at this point we've
gotten the hang of it and we've used the
exact amount now when we mark this as
done I want to show you something let's
go back to our manufacturing order and
if we check over here to the components
tab we'll notice the differences between
consumed and the reserved columns the
quantities displayed in the consume
column follow what we typed in the work
order now the colors are the numbers
over here inside of the consumed
indicate if the amounts consumed were
greater than less than or equal to what
was specified on the bomb orange over
here indicates under over consumption
sorry about that over we use 1.1 instead
of one black indicates under consumption
23 instead of 24 and finally green is a
perfect score now Odo also lets you
change component consumption directly
from the manufacturing order form like
just like this actually and boom
now this actually allows you to complete
the manufacturing order without going
into the tablet view now when we Mark
the manufacturing order as done you'll
notice something pops up a consumption
warning appears since we had previously
configured flexible consumption to be
allowed with a warning now when we
confirm the consumption and everything
you'll notice that odoo now has updated
the to consume and to the match the
consumed column you know for bookkeeping
purposes now also you notice down here
we actually have that extra egg as well
because it's set aside is unconsumed
since we use fewer eggs than what was
called for now the consumed quantities
are also recorded inside of our product
moves which we can view using that smart
button that I showed off since we
consumed a different quantity of
ingredients and expected the cost of our
final product will be slightly different
and you can actually see that if we go
into odu's cost analysis over here now
thankfully Otis cost analysis report
keeps track of that for us now since
odor records manufacturing costs based
on the exact quantities consumed the
actual product cost will differ slightly
from the car cost listed on the bill of
materials now finally I think it's time
that I show you what that blocked
consumption looks like so we're gonna
create a new one all right dear so here
we are in our bill of materials now if
we click in the gcflame and go into
miscellaneous this time we're going to
select block because I'd like to show
you what that looks like when certain
actions may or may not be available now
these will depend on the user's access
rights only users with Administration
rights can close a manufacturing order
if the components used do not match what
is specified on the bill of materials so
Mark demo for example has user rights on
the manufacturing app but not
administrator rights this is set in the
settings app by an admin now for more on
this check out our getting started
e-learning videos which cover this now
let's see what blocked flexible
consumption looks like from a user
profile with limited access alright a
doer so here I am Mark demo and we're
gonna go and create a new Mo for that
cheese souffle that the boss man wants
perfect everything looks good I better
get on this immediately so what are we
going gonna do we're gonna go into work
orders and start into our tablet view
all right a doer so here we are inside
of our tablet and similarly 1.1 liters
we'll validate that
and now this time when we do that it'll
tell us
if we do 23 eggs here
continue production instead of
validating and then something cool
happens now you'll notice that when we
tried to move forward because of the
super large eggs I'll be forced to click
the continue production Button as you
saw and notice that there's this extra
step that is basically asking me for
consuming the last egg and if we
validate that as well it allows us to
move forward to our parmesan cheese
which has now actually been unchanged as
well for some reason we use the same
amount of cheese we validate that and we
mark this as done
and if we go back over here and we go
over to our manufacturing order there's
something I want to show you all it's
still too close why well if we hit Mark
is done you'll notice we have a
consumption warning that basically tells
us we don't have powers there's no way
for me to validate this and move forward
since I am a limited user so how does
this look like for a user with admin
rights as Mark demo cannot continue well
I'm going to show you what that looks
like alright odor so Mitchell admin here
now we're going to go up to our
manufacturing orders and we've got to go
back to that one that Mark demo just did
alright so I noticed something
immediately now if you notice we did not
actually consume 24 eggs so I can
actually modify this because I'm an
admin and now I can finally hit Mark is
done and you'll notice I get that same
consumption warning but this time since
I have way more power than Mark and
Steve I can actually Force this and by
selecting it
I can actually confirm the adjusted
amounts consumed and Mark this ammo as
done and as you notice it actually does
that for the to consume there you have
it flexible consumption it's a helpful
tool that allows companies to keep
better track of their components even
when a different quantity than expected
is consumed now this functionality can
be tailored to the specific needs of
each Company by choosing who can and who
cannot approve the use of different
quantities of components that's all for
