================================================================================

what's up o doers it's good to see you
again today we're talking about work
order dependencies as you've already
learned work orders are smaller
operations within manufacturing orders
or MOS it's very common for anmo to have
more than one work order and often times
it's critical that certain work orders
be completed before others that's where
work order dependencies come in let's
use our table product as an example
manufacturing the table requires two
work orders cut the table legs and
attach legs to the table it doesn't take
a genius to figure out that we should
cut the table legs first then attach
them to the table if we didn't we'd end
up with a table that was way too tall
one might even say cartoonishly tall
let's jump into Odo now so I can show
you how to make sure all of your tables
are the right height with the help of
work order
dependencies in order to use work order
dependencies we need to make sure a
couple things are enabled first I'll
start by navigating to the manufacturing
application clicking on configuration
and then down to settings here I need to
make sure that I have ticked the check
boxes for work orders and work order
dependencies the later setting only
appears once the former one is checked
with these settings enabled I can add
work orders to Emos and make specific
work orders dependent upon the
completion of others pretty cool right
I've already enabled both settings but
once you've done so in your database
make sure to click save up at top just
to make sure that the changes are
applied now let's take a look at the
bill of materials or bomb for our table
product to do that I'll navigate to
products and then select bill of
materials and then select our table
bomb I click on the operations tab I can
see that the manufacturing process
requires two operations cut table legs
and attach legs to table top as I
previously mentioned we want to make
sure that we cut the table legs before
we attach them to the table top to do so
I'm going to start by clicking on our
miscellaneous Tab and then I want to go
ahead and tick the checkbox next to
operation
dependencies and then I'll go ahead and
click the save button to put the changes
into
effect now if we return back to the
operations
Tab and click on the attached legs to
tabletop
operation this popup appears and we also
have a blocked by field that appears in
the popup window I'll click into that
field and select the cut table legs
option from the drop- down menu and now
the attach legs to table top operation
is blocked by the cut table legs
operation meaning we must complete that
operation first finally I'll go ahead
and click
save and by default the blocked by
settings are not displayed on the
operations tab but if we do want to see
them all I have to do is click the extra
options button here on the right make
sure that's teched and then here we have
it doing so causes the block by colum to
appear on the tab where I can see the
attached legs to tabletop operation is
blocked by the cut table legs operation
all right our bomb is configured the way
we want it now let's see it in action
first I'll click on operations and then
manufacturing orders and then I'll click
new in the upper hand
corner then I'll add our table to the
product field and then just click
confirm next I'll click on the work
orders tab to see that both of our work
orders in the status column and as we
can see the cut table legs appears as
ready and the other operation attached
legs to tabletop appears as waiting for
another operation because ODU knows that
we need to cut the table legs first now
I'll click the plan button up at the
top and to see this carried out we can
click on the planning button here at the
top and click on Planning by production
and then we'll be able to see the
overall calendar so let's zoom into the
planning calendar Day by clicking on the
calendar button here and selecting today
now we can see the cut table legs work
order has been scheduled first and the
attach legs to tabletop work order is
scheduled
after this is also indicated by the
arrow leading from the first work order
to the second if I drag attach liks to
tabletop work order first it'll appear
as
red to fix this I can simply drag and
drop the work order so it's scheduled
after
and now we're ready to manufacture the
table by completing these work orders
and that's all I've got for you today
folks thanks for sticking around and
like always I'll see you next time
