welcome back to the final boss of the
costing series the first in first style
casting method AKA fifo
today we'll be jumping between a Womble
combo of apps so get ready to continue
growing your knowledge fifo
manufacturing is like waiting in line in
a workshop products are manufactured and
stored in a specific order the stuff
that gets made first are sent out for
sale first and then the next items in
line are basically delivered next now
here's the interesting part so the fifo
costing method pools the cost of the
oldest manufactured item in stock and
uses it to determine the product cost so
right now the cost to make a table is a
hundred and ten dollars but once that
product is removed from the stock the
next oldest manufactured product
determines the cost now fifo is
straightforward to gears and has been
useful to update fluctuating product
costs in this video you'll see how fifo
works when we produce two tables
constructed with the same components but
bought at different prices so enough
Chit Chat let's get started right now
first to check the value and the
quantity of the components I have in
stock let's go to the inventory
valuation report now firstly you're
going to want to have developer mode on
otherwise you won't see it I'm going to
quickly show you where you would find
that we're going to go into settings
down at the bottom under developer tools
you don't see this it might be related
to access rights for more information on
that please check out the documentation
otherwise let's make our way over to
inventory reporting valuation and there
we have it all right let me show you
basically a couple tips now first we
want to group this by the product and
that'll make it a whole lot nicer and
easier to see and then another thing
that I could show you is a quick tip
while we're here if you click this
favorites filter right there save the
current search you could change the name
if you'd like we're going to use that by
default and hit save perfect now
whenever we open this up it'll default
us to the nicer view right there which
makes it a lot easier now we're going to
look for the fifo components we have our
table which currently doesn't have a
value or anything moved our table legs
and our tabletop you see the nested
table legs and table tops where the with
their actual respective values over here
now right now the components we have in
stock are four table legs for a total of
twenty dollars and one tabletop for ten
dollars these are to manufacture my
first table which we'll do now now
before I go remember those two values
twenty dollars four legs ten dollars one
table top as we go through the flow Oda
will update my components prices over
here in the terms of the valuation as I
process manufacturing orders which we
will come back to later at some point so
remember that all right I'll begin
making my first table so we're going to
go into the manufacturing app operations
and Manufacturing orders and now to
prepare to build one we can select new
up here and what product did we want we
want that fifo table
all right everything here initially
looks pretty good and the table is
already added so we can now click
confirm beautiful
we can see that this manufacturing order
will use four table legs and one table
top eventually in the two consume field
over here now we'll click on the work
orders Tab and we're going to type in
right now that I spent 60 Minutes
working on this very hard worker we're
gonna log that time and we can easily
adjust the time spent on a manufacturing
order right here all right now that
we're done with everything we're gonna
hit Marcus done and we're gonna apply
this and we're gonna finish everything
manufacturing now if you want to review
the cost analysis of the mo you have to
do is click that smart button I've been
showing you give that a second to load
and it'll tell us everything so right
now we can see that the table costs
eighty dollars total to make because it
used thirty dollars under the cost of
components plus fifty dollars of
operational cost for the assembly line
that we have right here
and we'll show you what that means now
all right for the next table I'll use
more expensive components so here's a
Jose Ignacio quick tip to help save time
we're going to go back to the ammo using
the breadcrumbs which today is Wonder
Bread because all of you are wonderful
we're gonna hit duplicate boom we've got
our draft set up and we're going to make
the same table and now we're gonna
finally confirm it with the new ammo
confirmed we see that we need to order
more components oh no it's red and not
available well let's pause this go out
of here and we need to restock so in our
case we're going to go into inventory
and what do we need to do oh doers we
need to replenish we're going to go into
replenishment we can see that our
components appear in the replenishment
report and it's that convenient no doers
let's select the boxes next to the stuff
that we need and then what do we do well
we just gotta hit oh doers
or doers that's a terrible joke with the
PO created let's finish ordering
components inside of the purchase app so
we're going to go back over here into
purchase we're gonna find the one that
we need for today which happens to be
right there there's our replenishment
report now let's say that due to a
shortage of lumber we had to buy from
the greedy Giant and he doubled the
price of our components so we're going
to change the unit price of each of
these These are now ten dollars
these are twenty dollars
oh no that is very sad and now I want to
cry nothing we could do about that so
we'll go ahead and confirm the order
receive our products
and now we're finally done with all our
parts over here and also we gotta
validate this before I forget oh doers
and apply with all our parts let's give
back to our manufacturing so let's go
back to our table so we're going to go
inside of the manufacturing app
operations manufacturing orders the most
recent one all right there we are now
you'll see that the component status
field has been updated and everything is
there so let's go back over here and lie
about working a full hour right now and
we're basically done we're gonna Mark is
done and again hit apply
all right
we're almost done I promise you let's
check the cost analysis report again now
this time and you'll see that it's a
more expensive table now it's a hundred
and ten dollars due to the more
expensive components that we use nearly
doubling ugh can't do anything about it
all right now we'll see though however
if we go back over here and we check all
of this what ended up happening though
well we can see that the cost if we
click on the actual table itself
is still eighty dollars per unit now why
is this well when we check our overview
report for the table which you can do
using the bill of material smart button
up here and checking it
inside of here and now finally I almost
forget we actually want to see this
overview report right there we can
actually see that even though the bomb
cost has been updated to a hundred and
ten dollars the actual product cost
follows the cost of the earliest
manufactured product that we have in
stock which is that first table at
eighty dollars
and isn't that interesting
but let's see what happens when we sell
off the first product we manufacture the
eighty dollar table our customer Mark is
super excited to get one of our awesome
tables because they're awesome so we'll
just navigate over to the sales app
because we'd like to sell something and
we're gonna make a new quotation and who
did I just say is buying this well I
said Mark is buying it so there's Mark
all right we're gonna sell them one of
our fifo tables so we'll find that out
all right everything looks good here so
once that we're done we're going to
confirm this
and finally when the delivery order is
processed which in our case we click on
the delivery
validate immediate transfer and apply
I want to show you something the 80
table will be removed from stock which
we can see in the inventory valuation
report which if we go out of here and go
back into inventory reporting valuation
and finally here we go to our fifo
section you'll notice immediately
remember the valuations for the table
legs and the tabletop from before since
we sold off the last table to Mark and
purchase the more expensive components
those values have actually changed
accordingly notice instead of what we
had before now we actually have it set
to
forty dollars because of the changes for
the table legs and finally
twenty dollars for the actual top now
and when we click on the actual fifo
table drop down you noticed immediately
the first table was taken out at the
eighty dollars in the 110 one is right
below it as well the table delivered to
Mark is the first eighty dollar one
we're actually going to click on that
row just so that I could take you over
here to the order and so that I could
show you something immediately
and basically if we click on that little
product form over here
what does that cost say now doers and
here we arrive on the table's product
form which tells us the product cost is
automatically updated to the cost of the
next earliest manufactured product that
we have on hand which happens to be a
hundred and ten dollars now instead of
the eighty dollars how cool
all right so that's how fifo works so
doers thanks for sticking through to the
end of this costing series hopefully you
found a costing method that works for
you and if you have any questions be
sure to drop them in the comments send
me an email smash that like I don't know
everything for more manufacturing videos
and everything else odoo be sure to
check out the description below and as
always remember I'll see you next time
