================================================================================

Hello, Odooers, and welcome back! Today, 
we’re taking a look at the Manufacturing  
app to see how one-step manufacturing works.
When using one-step manufacturing to produce  
a product, Odoo creates a manufacturing order, 
but does not create a transfer order for the  
movement of components to the production location, 
nor does it create one to move finished products  
to the location where they are stored.
Product counts still update, based on the  
amounts used or produced, but there’s no 
need to worry about validating transfers. 
This makes it a great option for companies with 
smaller inventory and manufacturing operations. 
Don’t worry, though. If you want to create 
transfer orders for those stock movements, you  
can always enable two or three-step manufacturing, 
which we’ll cover in the next tutorial. 
But for now, let’s dive into our database to 
see how Manufacturing in One Step works in Odoo! 
First off, I should mention that Odoo 
enables one-step manufacturing by default. 
However, I want to quickly show you where 
that setting is enabled, just in case  
it’s been changed for some reason.
So, let’s open the Inventory app,  
and let's click on the Configuration 
subheading, and select Warehouses. 
Then, I’ll select ‘Main Warehouse’ 
to open its settings page. 
In the “Manufacture” field on the 
bottom right, I can select the number of  
manufacturing steps used for the warehouse.
As you can see, “Manufacture (1 step)”  
has already been enabled. Great!
Now, we do have one more setting  
we need to worry about, which is Work Orders.
Work orders allow us to break our manufacturing  
orders down into smaller operations, which 
can be carried out at different work centers. 
All you need to do for that is to jump into the 
Manufacturing app, so let’s jump into here, click  
on the Configuration subheading and Settings, 
Then, I’ll enable the checkbox next to ‘Work  
Orders’ here at the top, which you can see I’ve 
already done. And don’t forget to save it too! 
Awesome!
Ok, now we’re ready to start manufacturing  
some products! So let’s select the Operations 
subheading and click on Manufacturing Orders. 
As you can see here, I've already created 2 
MOs for our “Coat Rack” product in advance,  
so we can skip right to the fun part.
Now, there are 2 ways to process an  
MO in Odoo: from the MO itself, 
and from the Shop Floor module. 
Let’s use the first manufacturing order as an 
example of processing an order on the MO itself. 
On the MO, we can see the components 
required to manufacture the Coat  
Rack under the Components tab.
By clicking on the Work Orders tab,  
we can see the work order operations that need 
to be performed to manufacture the product. 
In this case, we have two work orders: 
“Drill Pole” and “Insert Dowels”, which  
are carried out at two different work centers 
as we can see here in the Work Center column. 
In the Status column, we can see that the first 
work order is “Ready”, while the second work order  
is “Waiting for another WO,” since we need 
to complete the Drill Pole work order first. 
To process a work order, all I need to 
do is click “Start” to begin work at  
the work center, and then “Done” when 
I’m finished. Pretty simple, right? 
Once I do that, the work order’s status 
changed to “Finished”, and the next work  
order’s status changed to “Ready”.
So, I’ll just complete the second  
work order the same way that I completed the 
first. So I'll click "Start" and "Done". Great! 
Now that all work orders have been completed, 
we can close the MO by clicking the “Produce  
All” button at the top of the page.
Awesome, we’ve just produced one  
unit of our Coat Rack product!
Now, I want to show you how to  
complete the same workflow using the Shop 
Floor module. So, let’s jump over there to  
see how that’s done. So I’m going to go back 
to the dashboard and click on Shop Floor. 
The Shop Floor module is great because it 
allows your Manufacturing employees to see  
an overview of every MO, as well as the 
work orders assigned to each work center. 
For a full overview of the module, make sure 
to check out the Shop Floor overview video,  
which I’ll link down below.
Okay, right now, we just have  
one MO for our second Coat Rack.
The MO lists our first work order,  
“Drill Pole”, and I can see that the work center 
where it’s scheduled to be carried out by clicking  
the “Drill Station 1” button.
After completing the order,  
I just need to click “Mark as Done”, 
which causes the work order to fade away. 
Once it disappears completely, the next 
work order appears at its assigned work  
center. We can go there by clicking on 
the Assembly Station 1 here at the top. 
Let’s go ahead and “Mark as Done” as well. 
Since this is the final work order for the MO, a  
“Close Production” button appears.
This button has the same effect as  
the “Produce All” on the MO itself. 
I’ll click it now to close the MO. 
And BOOM! That’s another Coat Rack 
ready to be sent to a lucky customer! 
Once again, we find ourselves at the 
end of another incredible Odoo tutorial. 
Today, we learned about 
the one-step manufacturing,  
and walked through two different ways to 
complete a manufacturing order using one step. 
Join us next time, and we’ll get you up-to-speed 
on manufacturing products using two and three  
step manufacturing.
See ya there, Odooers!
