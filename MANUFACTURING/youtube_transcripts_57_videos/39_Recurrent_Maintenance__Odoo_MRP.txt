what's up o doers and welcome back
missed you so much since our last chat
sometimes equipment or work centers
require regular maintenance to prevent
them from breaking down this is called
you guessed it preventative maintenance
which I can schedule using the recurrent
maintenance feature when creating new
maintenance requests we can use
recurrent maintenance to schedule the
creation of identical maintenance at
regular intervals let's jump into our
Odo database now so we can see
how all right here we are on the main
dashboard of the maintenance app first
thing we need to do is create a new
maintenance request and to do so we're
just going to click at maintenance on
the top and then maintenance requests
followed by clicking new in the upper
leftand corner now for this maintenance
request let's say we have a handsaw that
needs to be sharpened once a week to
keep it sharp so in the request field
I'm going to enter sharpen
handsaw now in the equipment field I'm
going to click into it to show the drop
down menu and then we're just going to
click on
handsaw now we want this to be sharpened
on Friday at 4:30 p.m. so it's ready for
work first thing on Monday morning on
the schedule date field to the right if
we click into that a popup calendar
appears and here's where we can select
the upcoming Friday and down at the
bottom I can enter the minute and hour
the request should be processed these
fields use a 24-hour clock so I'm going
to enter the values of 16
and
30 which corresponds to 4:30 p.m.
finally it will'll just click apply to
schedule the date at this date and
time now let's make this maintenance
recurring first we're going to change
the maintenance type from corrective to
preventative and when we do this causes
a recurrent check boox to appear here on
the right directly below the duration
field now if I take the recurrent check
box
repeat every setting appears here I can
specify how often and for how long the
maintenance request should repeat and by
default requests are scheduled to recur
once a week forever now I can enter any
number here in the first field and then
in the second field I can change this to
days weeks months and even years but
we'll change this back to weeks and in
the Third Field I can change forever to
an until field which causes a fourth
field to appear where we can enter
another date when we want this
maintenance to
end as I mentioned we want this
maintenance request to occur once a week
and forever so we're going to change
this from until back to
Forever and just like that we've
scheduled a recurrent maintenance
request now let's navigate to
maintenance at the top and then
maintenance calendar to see how these
requests have been
scheduled first in the drop down menu
here in the top left we're going to
change this from week to month
and when we do we're able to see the
maintenance requests have been scheduled
for each
Friday for each request after the
current one a number is attached so we
know how many repetitions it is after
the upcoming
request for example the second request
has a plus one tag after its title this
tells us that it's the first repetition
of the current request you should also
know that deleting any of these requests
will delete every other request for
example let's use the right arrows to
show the calendar for next
month and if we click into any of these
requests and select delete every request
will be deleted however if I return to
the form by clicking
edit I also have the option to untick
the recurrent checkbox doing so will
delete every request except for the one
that's scheduled to be completed next
now let's see how to manage requests
from the can band view which I can
access by navigating to maintenance and
then maintenance
requests despite the fact that multiple
requests are scheduled for our
maintenance calendar only the next
upcoming request appears on the can band
view however let's see what happens when
we complete this request I can drag and
drop it into the repaired section which
marks it as done now when I reload my
screen
the next scheduled request appears in
the new request
column I can tell it's the next request
because the date on its cand card is one
week ahead from the previous
one this will continue to happen each
time we complete a recurrent maintenance
request and that's all I've got for you
today folks you now know how to create
and manage recurring maintenance
requests thanks for stopping by and I'll
see you next time
