What's up o doers and welcome back.
Previously we covered how to manufacture
products with onestep manufacturing
process. But today we're going to take
it a step further or two and explore how
to manufacture products using two and
three-step processes. And that's a must
for companies with larger manufacturing
and inventory operations. Tracking not
only what gets made, but also where
components come from and where finished
products are stored helps keep
everything run smoothly. In two-step
manufacturing, ODU creates a transfer to
move components from storage to the
production area. However, once
manufacturing is complete, finished
products don't get an automatic transfer
to storage. On the other hand, in
three-step manufacturing, ODO adds
another transfer. First moving
components to production where we do the
building, then moving finished products
to storage. While these workflow change
how materials and products move, the
actual manufacturing process remains the
same as in the one-step manufacturing.
So, we won't dive into that again here,
but if you need a refresher, check out
our previous video linked down below.
All right, let's get started and see how
these workflows come to life in
Odo. All right, to start, let's define
how the products move by opening up our
inventory application. And from here,
we're going to select configuration
followed by settings. On our settings
page, we're going to scroll all the way
down to our warehouse section and make
sure that we have multi-step routes
ticked and enabled, just like so. So, if
you haven't done so in your database,
make sure to tick that and click save
before moving on. Now, there's two ways
we can configure our warehouse routes.
First, we can click back into
configuration and click this warehouses
option right here. Or we can click this
set warehouse routes link directly under
the multi-step routes option.
When we click that link, it takes us to
a page that shows us all of our current
warehouses in this database. From here,
you can select any warehouse that you
want to configure. And in this case,
it's going to be our main
warehouse. So, this page defines the
default paths that products move through
in your warehouse, including when you
have to manufacture something. For more
about this page, check out our basic
warehouse setup video. But on the
warehouses page, we're going to find the
manufacturer field, and we're going to
enable one of these three options. For
this video, I'm going to select pick
components, manufacture, then store
products, aka our three-step
manufacturing
process. So, even though we're selecting
the three-step option, we'll still see
the entire two-step process before
moving on to that third step. That way,
we get the best of both worlds. Now, if
you need to make sure to enable the
options and then click save before
moving
on. So, for this video, we'll be using
our wooden bird feeder product as an
example. So, let's jump into our
manufacturing application, head to
products, and select products once
again. And here, we could check the
stock counts for our wooden bird feeder.
Looks like we have four. And we can also
see the components used to manufacture
it. So, when we click into the wooden
bird feeder product, we can see that we
have four on hand. And we also have a
smart button for our bill of materials.
And when we click into this bill of
materials, select our wooden bird feeder
bomb. Here we can see all the components
used to make the wooden bird
feeder. Now we're going to click
products and products once again to see
our quantity on hand for each component.
And here I can see that I have 184
pieces of cedar wood, 46 units of
hanging wire, and another 46 units for
our hook.
So keep these numbers in mind because
we'll be checking on them later. All
right, now it's time for the fun part.
We're going to select operations and
then manufacturing orders. And then to
create a new MMO, we're just going to
click new in the upper lefthand corner.
Now for the product field, we're just
going to select our wooden bird
feeder. And we're also going to leave
the quantity set to one. And if we hit
confirm, we can go ahead and see that
our to consume column right here will
require four pieces of cedar wood, one
piece of our hanging wire, and one hook
as
well. So now once everything's
confirmed, I can see the component
status right here shows available, but
it says available in orange. The color
is orange because the components still
need to be transferred to our production
location. ODO reminds us to grab our
components in another way in our work
orders tab right here. And here for
assembly line one in the status column,
it shows that we are waiting for
components. Okay, so since everyone's
telling us to, let's go ahead and grab
those components. I'm going to click
this transfer smart button here at the
top. And doing so takes us to a pick
operation for my components. Here we can
see our source location is our warehouse
stock and the products will be moved to
our destination location which is our
pre-production area. Now remember odoers
if you don't find your components when
you know you have them in stock double
check whether or not they're at your
pre-production
location. Now once the components are
moved over all we have to do is click
validate and then I'll click this
manufacturing smart button to get back
to the
MO. Very cool. Now that we have
everything we need, we can see that the
component status is now available but in
green. So, let's go ahead and click into
the shop floor button right here and
choose assembly line one for our work
center. And you might not see anything
at first, but don't panic. That just
means you're not logged in. And to log
in, all you have to do is click add
operator and add yourself right there.
So, I'll build the bird feeder, then
click register product, and then click
validate. And since I'm done with this
operation, I'm just going to click mark
as
done. Amazing. Now, we need to paint the
bird feeder. And we can find that here
in our paint center. And once that's all
done, I'm just click mark as done and
then close
production. So, if we were using
two-step manufacturing on the settings
page for our warehouse, the
manufacturing process would be complete
at this point. However, since we're
using that three-step manufacturing
process, there's still one more thing we
need to do. So, let's click into the
MOS's breadcrumb here at the top. And we
have a second transfer that's been added
to the transfer smart button. So, let's
click
it. This time, we can see we have to
complete the SFP or store finished
product transfer to move our finished
bird feeder into inventory. So, to do
so, I'm going to click this SFP
transfer.
And here we can see that the current
status is
ready. Then I'll click validate here in
the upper leftand corner at the top of
the page. And voila, we've manufactured
one bird feeder and stored it. And
that's a wrap odoers. You now know how
to manufacture products using two and
three-step workflows. Keep exploring ODO
to streamline your operations and stay
tuned for more tips and tutorials. Until
then, I'll see you in the next video.
