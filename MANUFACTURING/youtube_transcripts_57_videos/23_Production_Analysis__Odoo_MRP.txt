hello doers my name is hos ignasio and
it's good to see you again now today
we're jumping into manufacturing
reporting specifically the production
analysis report you see there are a lot
of questions that you have to ask
yourself when running a manufacturing
operation how long does it take to
manufacture each product how much does
it cost how much do I need to pay my
workers for each product they
manufacture and the list goes on if you
want your operation to be profitable
these are all important factors to
consider and luckily the production
analysis report and Odo manufacturing
app can tell you all of that and so much
more so enough chitchat let's hop into
our database now to see how it all works
so to open up the production analysis
report I'm actually going to navigate
over to our manufacturing application
select reporting up at the top
production analysis and there we are so
by default the report is displayed as a
line chart but I could also view it if I
wanted to as something such as a bar
chart or a pie chart which is always my
favorite one each graph type shows the
data broken down by weeks you can also
view the data inside of a pivot table
format by selecting it up here in the
top right corner and there you have it
so each row that we have over here on
the pivot table shows the data for one
specific product but let's jump back
into our line chart because that was a
little bit
intense okay so the data presented and
the way it's displayed are affected by
two factors we have the measures drop
down menu that we have over here and the
search bar that we have up at the top
Center if I click into this measures
menu once again I can actually select
from a variety of different data sets by
default average total cost slun is being
used but I can also choose a different
metric like let's assume average
operation cost as you can see only one
measure option can be selected at a time
with a data set selected we can use the
search bar over here to show how it's
displayed on the report by default a
filter is enabled so only data for demos
completed during the current year are
the ones that are shown I can also add a
custom filter by entering a product's
name into the search bar for instance I
could type in the word let's assume it's
coat
R and look at that only the data for
that specific product is shown speaking
of the search bar if we click on this
little down arrow that we have over here
we have our Mega menu filter and
grouping options so let's talk about one
area and it is actually the end date
section that we have and this allows me
right here that I used and the
comparison to be able to see a desired
time period for the data the group by
section that we have over here in the
center allows me to group data by
products or end day and finally the one
that I glanced over earlier is our
comparison area which is our end dat
previous period end date previous year
as well so both of these options allow
us to compare data from two different
time periods we're going to use this
section in a use case later in the video
so I won't go into too much detail about
it right this instant the the main thing
that you should know is that the
comparison feature should only be used
with the pie chart graph type or the
pivot table using a comparison on a
different view won't have any effect all
right with all of those nitty-gritty
details out of the way I want to close
this video by showing you a few use
cases for the production analysis report
so first we're actually going to want to
reset this report to its default state
by clicking on the refresh button inside
of our browser once that that refreshes
we'll continue so for our first use case
we're going to compare two different
products our Oak chair and an Arcane
chair just to see which takes longer to
produce this can be useful when deciding
how much of your manufacturing resources
should be dedicated to one product or
another so I'm going to keep the default
end dat filter in place and I'm going to
start by entering the names of the
products that we want to compare inside
of the search bar so the very first one
that I'm going to type in is that Oak
chair select it and then the next one
that I said cane chair select it okay
now we have both of them right there so
I'm going to open up the search bar drop
down menu now this time around and this
time I'm going to select the product
option underneath the group ey and we're
already getting somewhere so now I'm
also going to open up the menus drop the
measures drop down small o dupsy over
here and we're going to select duration
of operations because remember I said
which one takes longer and finally all I
need to do is select the bar Ty type of
graph right there now we have it and wow
as you can see we now see the average
time it takes to produce one unit of
each of these products and well it looks
like it takes takes us twice as long to
make one cane chair based on this we can
make an informed decision about whether
we want to keep producing the same
number of cane chairs or maybe dedicate
more resources over here to producing
our oak chairs so that's pretty cool all
right let's refresh the page once again
to reset it and this time it's going to
be faster okay so for this next example
we're going to take a look at how to use
the reports comparison feature let's say
that we want to compare quarters one and
two of this fiscal year to see which
items we spent the most money producing
in of each quarter so I'm going to start
by selecting the pie chart cuz remember
I mentioned that it only works in those
ones so I'm going to click on measures
drop down over here once again and this
time I want to see total cost great now
I'm going to open up the drop down menu
of the search bar once again and this
time what I want to click on is the end
date section that we had over here and
you'll notice it lets us select some
other stuff I want to add the Q2 filter
over there as well and finally the other
one that I want to see is the comparison
section I'm going to select the end dat
previous period over here just so that I
could see that and as you can see
selecting this option divides the pie
chart into two sections the outer
section that we have over here is Q2 of
2024 and the inner section that we have
inside of here shows us
rq1 based on this we can see that the
products that we spent the most money
producing in the second quarter were our
looks like a bike and a cabinet one
wonderful so during the first quarter
the product that we spent the most money
producing was once again the cane chair
keeps coming back so if I had selected
the end date previous year filter
instead let's go see that
actually going up here to the
top the Inner Circle would show the same
time period as the Outer Circle quarter
two but for the previous year in this
case that would actually be
2023 and that brings us to the end of
this tutorial video if you've been
paying attention you'll know that
there's quite a lot that you can do with
the production analysis report now this
video provided a few examples but it
would be impossible to cover every
single way the report can be used there
is simply far too many options which is
exactly what makes it so powerful so
that doers the best thing that you can
do is jump into your database and play
around with all the different options to
see how they interact and whether or not
you break stuff that's all for today
folks I'll see you next time
