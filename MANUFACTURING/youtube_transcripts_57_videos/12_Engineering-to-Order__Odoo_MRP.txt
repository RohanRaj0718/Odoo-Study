hello my ODU Cadets and welcome back for
another training Mission at stealthy
wood HQ today's assignment complete a
sales order for a customer who wants a
dining table designed and manufactured
to their exact specifications why
because here at stealthy wood we have a
wide selection of products available in
our regular inventory this includes
standard products as well as those with
variants enabling customers to choose
from a range of customization options
however
sometimes a customer wants us to design
and manufacture an item that we don't
normally sell this process is referred
to as engineer to order or etto for my
acronym lovers and it allows us to work
with a customer to create a custom
product that would be otherwise
unavailable to them so enough chitchat
Cadets let's jump in now to see how that
platform supports this
workflow so before getting started on
the engineer to order workflow we need
to make sure that ODU is properly
configured the first thing to do is
confirm that the replenish on order or
MTO route is an archive the MTO route is
used to automatically create a
manufacturing or purchase order for a
product only after a sales order for it
is confirmed this is useful for products
that are engineered to order since they
are only manufactured when a customer
orders them the MTO route is archived by
default as I said to unarchive it we're
actually going to go over here into
inventory and configuration and settings
now you want to scroll down over here to
reach warehouse and you see that
checkbox next to multi-step routes well
you guessed it at this point you want to
make sure that that is enabled and that
you hit save up here at the top all
right now that you do that a routes
option will appear on the top
configuration menu so you want to go up
to configuration and routes once the
select it it basically shows you all of
them now as you can tell I've already
unarchive the MTO route so let's
unarchive a different route as an
example instead to do so we're going to
click on filters appear here archived
and there we have it we have this uh
cross do one now once that you select it
over here you you can actually click on
this action button and boom you guessed
it unarchive and just like that if I
remove the archive filter there it is
right there and then now appears on the
routes page meaning it can be used for
our workflows all right so up next let's
head over to the project app because I
want to show you something okay so here
you can see that I've already created an
engineer to order project this will help
us keep track of the stages for each
etto order if I click on the actual
project you'll see that I've also
created four stages over here we have
waiting design review and finished now
let's head out of here because I want to
show you more stuff I'm just doing that
today we're going to go into sales over
here okay and you want to look at the
products perfect so inside of here I
want to make sure that our products are
set up correctly so first we have the
etto service product over here now this
represents the process of having our
employees design and engineer the
product based on the customer
specifications here you can see that
I've actually set the product type over
here to service why and the units of
measure all also to hours why well this
is basically set that way since the
customer will be build per hour of work
that our employees do this service will
cost $100 per hour and that's how that's
calculated and then finally I've also
set the create on order field that we
have right there to task inside of the
project engineer to order just so that
everything works properly now this will
ensure that a new task is created in the
project every time we confirm a sales
order for the etto service all right now
let's go out of here and go back via the
breadcrumbs which today is ETO bread and
select the actual product over here now
this is a generic product that we've
created that can be added to the initial
sales order and then reconfigured after
the design process on the general
information tab you'll notice
immediately that the product type over
here is set to storable why well since
this will be a physical product that
we're going to manufacture the sales
price is left as $1 just because we
don't know yet how much the final
product will cost this will be updated
later on the sales order itself next if
I click on inventory over here I want to
direct your attention over here you want
to make sure that the MTO and
manufacturer routes are both enabled the
MTO route must always be selected
alongside another route or else ODU
won't know how to replenish the product
this configuration tells ODU to create a
manufacturing order for the product
every time a sales order is placed for
it finally if I click on the building
material smart button up here at the top
here we see all of the product bombs and
if we select this bottom one called
template over here we can actually see
something that I've already configured
this bomb is just a template with the
components and the operations tabs both
empty over here now why did I do that
well that's because during the
manufacturing process I can duplicate
this template and configure it as needed
this is useful because it means that I
don't have to create a new bomb for each
ETO product I just need to configure a
new variation of the template and you do
that by selecting action and
duplicates so right now the other thing
that you can also tell for this this is
that in the reference field up at the
top I've entered template this will
allow us to easily distinguish between
the blank bomb and the ones that we can
figure for each custom product that we
produce and boom we're all set to sell
the etto service to a customer so let's
move on so now that we're all set to
sell the etto service to a customer and
then design and manufacture the exact
product that they're looking for we can
actually start the whole process by
actually staying here on the sales app
and selecting new on the quotations so
let's assume that our customer over here
is
corner and we need to now start adding
our product so we have an etto product
as well as an etto service over here now
for the service we do build it at a
minimum of 10 hours over here and it's
kind of important because additional
hours are added later depending on how
long the process actually takes so for
now we're going to leave it at the 10
hours now for the etto product I'm going
to enter what they wanted and they told
us they want a dining table very fancy
and I'm going to leave the unit price
right now at one because we won't know
the final price until the design is
complete we still want to add it to the
sales order though so that ano can
actually be automatically created once
the sales ORD is confirmed speaking of
that let's go confirm this over here and
we're ready now once that we did that a
few new smart buttons appeared at the
top of the page here we can actually see
that the sales order is now linked to
one project as well as one task over
here how to find it real quick now if I
click on the task smart button it's
going to take us over here to the
service one I could see that a new task
has been created with the sales order
number attached to it as a followup and
the task also displays the project it is
a part of which happens to be in our
case the engineer to order one that we
had and that's perfect so heading back
to the sales order using the breadcrumbs
which are sales order breadcrumbs the
manufacturing smartphone that we have up
here at the top it basically tells me
that a manufacturing order has been
created for the dining table I'm not
going to worry about that right now
though since the emmo is just a template
that we must must configure after the
components and operations for
manufacturing the product have actually
been confirmed and lastly we have the
create invoice button up here at the Top
This Way a customer is built for an etto
product and that will actually vary
based on the invoicing policies of each
company now for the purposes of this
demo we'll build the customer for
everything at the very end of the
workflow so don't worry about that
button for now with all of that out of
the way we can actually finally start to
work on the etto service itself so I'm
going to go out of here and head over to
the project app click on engineer to
order and you can already see that one
task right there and this is the one
that's titled with our sales order
perfect okay so for this project we'll
need the help of two employees Donald
Johnson who is the designer who will
Design the dining table and Robert Smith
the engineer who will review the design
plans so I'm going to select both of
them inside of this asses field so we
have Donald Johnson as I said and Robert
Smith now they're assigned and now we're
finally ready so now once the we're here
we can actually go over to the design
stage so that we can get things started
now our design Old Donald works with the
customer to design the dining table it
takes him 12 hours which he logs in the
time sheets tab over here you can do so
by hitting add a line select Donald
Johnson and at this point we're going to
put 12 right there
designing just because we could have
that just for the description right
there and finally with the design
finished he moves the task to the review
stage over here and we're going to go
through this now our engineer Robert
reviews the design that Donald created
and determines how much the finished
dining table will cost in this case he
says it's going to be
$1,000 which we're going to enter into
the sales order later so keep that in
mind right there now review takes an
additional 4 hours which he also logs
inside of the time sheets once again and
this time we are Robert so for this time
we're going to put a description of just
review because he reviewed that and he
said four hours
oh something new has happened all right
now that we're done here we're actually
going to move it over to the Finish
stage now I want you to make a quick
note of something now notice that the
remaining hours on the sales order field
over here is -6 this is because we've
exceeded the allocated hours specified
at the top of the time sheets tab that
we have up here at 10 which was set to
10 automatically based on the number of
hours on the sales order this is helpful
as it allows us to see how many
additional hours we need to build a
customer four so before moving on let's
return to the sales order using the
sales order smart button up at the top
very convenient actually we want to make
sure that all the pricing information
for the etto service and etto product is
correct we're going to have to do some
updates so for the service over here if
you notice our delivered column has
automatically updated to reflect the
total number of hours logged by our
employees we're going to enter that same
number over here for the quantity just
so that we can match these up boom
perfect and now the total price of the
service service updates automatically
now for the product we're actually going
to change this right now since our unit
price is different remember it happens
to be $1,000 as I said earlier it's a
very nice very nice dining table all
right now that we know the design of the
table and therefore the components and
operations required to create it we can
properly configure that template bomb
for the etto product so it's time we
head over to manufacturing outdo so here
the first thing I need to make sure is
that the template bomb is ected in the
bill of materials field over here and
now that it is we're going to select
that internal link over here all right
if I wanted to configure this template I
would want to actually first duplicate
it because I don't want to mess up the
template all right great now this
ensures that the template remains blank
and can be used for other custom
products in the future on this duplicate
one we're going to get rid of this
reference and we're going to put our
actual sales order that we had over here
which was 19 and now we can get started
by adding our components which happens
to be a table
top and then we also have six table legs
so you want to do this rather quickly
it's a pretty big table actually and
then for screws how many screws do we
want to say it takes well let's just say
that each one each leg has two all right
there we have 12 all right finally I'm
going to add the operations which
happens to be one which is going to be
cutting so we're going to type in cut
it's going to give it a work center and
we're going to do a new one and then the
next one is going to be I don't know we
have to assemble that table to O doers
so we're going to assemble and that one
is going to be at the assembly station
and we're going to close that out great
now after confirming that the new bomb
is saved we're going to return back over
here to our sales order or actually
sorry our manufacturing order my
apologies and back over here where the
bill of material template is selected we
want to select the right one which
happened to be 19 right there and you'll
notice everything has populated both in
the components and the work orders tab
as was specified by the bomb now after
we hit confirm up here at the top we
have something cool that happens I'm
going to select the work orders tab over
here and at this point normally our
workers would go into the tablet view to
complete them but I'm just going to
click Start and we're going to do done
on each one we're just going to move
very fast so that we can do this for
this flow all right and we're finished
now we can move on with all the work
orders completed I can actually mark
this as done up here at the top and that
basically confirms that the dining table
is completed so let's go back to our
sales order now and that's because we're
pretty much finished now so we're going
to go back over to our sales order and
now that the dining table has been
manufactured we can ship it out to our
customer however we still need to
invoice them so to do so I'm going to
click on the create invoice button up
here at the top and make sure that the
regular invoice option is selected on
the actual popup right there and now
once that we're done with that we're
going to click and create and view an
invoice and I'm going to wait at this
point because payment has been received
from the customer so I'm going to click
confirm and then I'm going to register
the payment from the customer and I'm
going to create the payments boom we're
all done right there with the payment
registered we're ready to process the
delivery of their new custom dining
table so finally we're going to return
to the sales order via our smart button
up at the top and I am finally almost
done so now that we're here we're going
to click on the delivery smart button
we're going to validate this and we're
going to apply this and that's to
confirm that the order has been shipped
to the customer and we're done with that
and so ends another training Mission
good job ODU cadetes
