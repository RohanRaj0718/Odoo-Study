What is up, Odoers, and welcome back.
Have you ever ordered something only for
it to show up months later or just way
late in general, and by the time it
arrives, you've already moved on and
you're just over your order? Delays like
that aren't just frustrating, but they
can hurt customer trust and just throw
off your entire workflow. So, in this
video, we're going to take a look at how
planning with accurate security lead
times help keep production on track and
orders on time. By estimating delivery
times properly, we make sure parts
arrive when we need them and products
are ready to ship without them sitting
in storage. So, what is lead time? It's
the number of calendar days it takes to
complete a process from start to finish.
And there are a few types you should
know about. First, we have customer lead
time. That's how many days pass between
when a product is ordered and when it
ships out of the warehouse. Now
remember, whenever we're talking about
customer lead time, we're essentially
talking about delivery lead time. Then
we also have manufacturing lead time,
and that's how long it takes to actually
build the product. Knowing these
timelines helps us plan smarter and hit
every deadline, so parts show up on time
and orders go out right when they
should. Alrighty, let's clickity clack
into the world of lead times and get
things
moving. Okay, so let's get started here
in the manufacturing app and take a look
at a product that I'm selling, which is
our industrial style shelf. To find it,
I'm just going to click products at the
top, followed by products once again,
and boom, there she is. So, I'm just
going to click to enter into that
product page. Now, there are a couple
different places where we can define the
lead time information. We'll enter the
manufacturing lead time on the products
bill of materials and the customer lead
time goes right here into the product
page. So, we're going to start with that
one. We'll just enter the inventory tab.
And in the logistics section, we can
find the customer lead time field right
here. And for this product, we can see
that it takes 10 days to process and
deliver. Next up, let's check out the
bill of material smart button here at
the top. Just click into that. And this
shows us all of the bill of materials
that are linked to the industrial style
shelf. And we're just going to click
this one and only one right here. Here
we can see a list of all the components
as well as the operations needed to make
this shelf. But we're interested in the
manufacturing lead time. So we're going
to switch over to this miscellaneous tab
right
here. So in this section, we have two
fields that we need to pay attention to.
We have manufacturing lead time right
here. And we also have days to prepare.
M
O manufacturing lead time which is how
long it takes to produce the product
from start to finish for this case is 3
days. And then moving into the next
field days to prepare manufacturing
order which is the number of days needed
to gather components or make
subasssemblies before production can
even start. You can set this manually by
clicking into the field or you can
simply click compute and ODO will
calculate it automatically based off
your bill of materials. So where does
this number come from? Let's go ahead
and take a look. If we jump back into
the components tab and click the little
arrow next to our Pinewood component,
which is the internal link button, it'll
take us to the product page of the
Pinewood product. Then from here, we can
click into the purchase tab. And right
off the bat, we can see that good vendor
delivers us this component within two
delivery days. Of all the components in
this bomb, Pinewood has the longest
delivery time. So, ODU calculates that
it'll take 2 days to get everything that
we need. That's why the days to prepare
MO field was automatically set to 2 days
because that's the earliest that we can
start manufacturing if we didn't have
any of the raw materials on hand.
So, in summary, a 10-day customer lead
time is the default timeline for
producing an industrial style shelf. It
takes two days to prepare the MMO, 3
days to manufacture the product, and a
5-day processing period to ship the
product to the customer. It's also worth
noting that the customer lead time isn't
linked to any other lead times. It's
manually set by us, the user, to capture
the entire replenishment process.
Let's take a look at an order that we
just received from our good friend Deco
Addict. Now, he placed this order
earlier today and wants to know when he
can expect his brand new industrial
style shelf. And right off the bat, we
can see that there's no available stock
for this product. And that's indicated
by this red icon right here in our
delivered column. And if we click on
this red icon, we get a clear message
noting that there's no future
availability for this product. And
that's because there's no MO that has
been created to produce the shelf. And
we also just haven't started building
one yet. So to get more details on this,
we can click this view forecast link.
And when we do that, takes us to a
forecast report for our industrial style
shelf. And from here, we'll click this
manufacturing forecast button. And when
we do this, opens up a bill of materials
overview. And this is what we see. We
can see that the next estimated
available date for the industrial style
shelf is 5 days from now. And it's also
shown in red. So what's causing this
delay? Well, we do know it takes 3 days
to manufacture the shelf. But since
we're currently out of pinewood, ODO
adds two more days for us to purchase
and receive those components before we
can even start production. So, now that
the lead time setup is all coming
together, we need a total of 5 days
before this product is ready to ship. We
need two days to get the materials and 3
days to build it. Looks like it's time
to give good vendor a call so we can
restock on our pinewood. Two days later.
And just like that, let's pretend two
days have passed. During that time, we
placed the order and received all seven
pieces of pinewood. Now, as you can see,
we have everything we need in stock, so
we can officially start that
manufacturing process for our industrial
style shelf. Oh, and check this out. The
estimated availability date for the
shelf has updated to 3 days from today,
which totally makes sense since it takes
exactly 3 days to build the shelf from
start to finish. We're officially ready
to roll. So, let's go ahead and head
over to our manufacturing application so
we can manufacture this industrial style
shelf. and maybe even get it shipped to
Deco Addict earlier than expected. So,
we'll start by heading back to the home
screen of our database and just opening
up the manufacturing application. And
from here, I'll click operations at the
top followed by manufacturing orders and
then simply click new in the upper
leftand
corner. Now, in the product field, I'm
going to enter and select our industrial
style shelf and then click confirm.
Now, when the MMO is confirmed, we can
see that the scheduled start date is set
to today and the scheduled end date is 3
days from now, which is when we expect
the shelf to be finished. But here's the
fun part. My manufacturing team just let
me know that the shelf is already done.
Total legends. So, I'll go ahead and
click produce all. And when I do,
that'll mark this mo as complete. And
just like that, it's time to get this
shelf over to Deco Attic. Looks like we
might just surprise him with an earlier
delivery than he was expecting. So,
let's go ahead and finish up this order
and make this happen. Now, we'll head
back to our homepage once again, but
this time we're going to enter into the
inventory app. And from here, we're just
going to click this one to deliver
button here in our delivery order
section. And look at that. It is for
Deco Addict. So, we'll just click into
this here. And all we have to do to
complete this is click
validate. And now this has been shipped
over to Deco Addict. And he got his
shelf much earlier than
expected. And there you have it.
Estimating delivery dates and planning
production doesn't have to be
complicated. ODU makes it easy to stay
on track. If you want, you can explore
more scheduling tutorials. Feel free to
check out our videos on planning and
master production. But that's all for
now. Go grab a snack, take a break, and
hey, if no one's told you today, you're
doing great. See you later, Odoers.
