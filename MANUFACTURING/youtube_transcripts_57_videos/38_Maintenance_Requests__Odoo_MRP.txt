what's up B doers like most
manufacturing operations our production
line consists of several work centers
along with the equipment we use at them
as you can imagine our work centers and
Equipment suffer from occasional
malfunctions and must be fixed when this
happens we can create a maintenance
request to make sure the issue is
brought to the attention of the relevant
maintenance team now there are multiple
ways to create maintenance requests
including through the maintenance app
itself from the emo on the manufacturing
app or from a work order in the shop
floor app so let's jump into our Odo
database so we can see how to create and
manage maintenance requests all right
the first thing we need to do is learn
how to create a new maintenance request
as I mentioned there are a few different
ways we can do this so let's start in
the maintenance
application from the maintenance
dashboard which shows me each of my
maintenance teams all I need to do is
navigate to maintenance at the top of
the screen and then click on maintenance
request and then click new to open up a
new maintenance request form I also have
the option to navigate to maintenance
once again and then maintenance calendar
and here I can click on a specific cell
to schedule a request for that date and
time and once I do this popup appears in
which I can give this request a name
before clicking create which would open
up the same form that we just
saw next let's hop over to the shop
floor
application here we need to select the
tab for a specific work center like our
saw station for example then I'll pick a
work order and click on the gear icon
that appears at the bottom right and
when I do all I have to click on is
request maintenance from the popup
window the final way to create a
maintenance request is through the
manufacturing application which I'll
navigate to
now then select operations at the top of
the screen and then manufacturing orders
then I'll select a manufacturing order
or Mo and at the top of the mo I can
click the maintenance request button and
when I do you guessed it maintenance
request form appears as you can see we
have a lot of options for creating
maintenance requests this provides
manufacturing options with lots of
flexibility in terms of who can create
requests and when they are created
during the manufacturing process now
let's see how to actually fill out one
of these forms we'll use this blank form
that we just opened and for example
let's say the power stopped working at
our saw station so let's give this
maintenance request a name something
simple and straightforward like no power
at saw
station perfect the created bu field is
automatically filled out with my name
but I can always choose a different
employee if
necessary below that we have the four
field which allows me to specify if the
request is being created for a piece of
equipment or the entire work center
we're creating this request for our saw
station so let's change this from
equipment to work
Center and when I do this causes a work
center field to appear and in this field
all I have to do is Select saw station
now directly below that in the worksheet
template field we can select a worksheet
for our maintenance employees to fill
out while processing this request we'll
cover worksheet templates in a different
video so I'm just going to leave this
blank for now the request date field is
locked in for today's date since today
is the day we're creating the request in
the maintenance type field here I can
select whether this maintenance is
corrective intended to fix an existing
issue or preventative which is intended
to prevent issues from occurring in the
future I'll leave this as corrective for
now now in the manufacturing order field
Theo is automatically selected since we
created the request from thato anytime
ano work order is selected a work order
field appears below and let's just say
the power issue occur during the cut
legs operation so we'll select that from
the drop- down field below
next I'll use the team field to assign
this request to our work center
team then I'll select a employee in the
responsible field to manage this request
and we'll use
Jose this is pretty urgent so for the
scheduled date let's select on the
calendar date for tomorrow by selecting
the date and then simply clicking apply
and I'm not too sure how long this
request is going to take so we'll leave
the duration field blank at zero so the
maintenance team can fill it out once
they're done now since this request is
created for a work center a block work
center checkbox appears this allows me
to prevent work orders from being
scheduled at the work center however
since we're creating this request from
anmo with the work orders that need to
be carried out at the saw station
ticking this checkbox will return an
error when we try to save the request so
I'm going to leave this blank for
now finally since this is such an
important issue issue let's give this a
three star priority so it appears at the
top of the maintenance request camand
view now in the notes section I'll leave
a brief note about the problem at the
work center I can do something
like not of the work Center's Outlet
provide any power can also provide
instructions through the instructions
tab but I'm not going to worry about
this for now since I'm not sure how to
fix the
issue all right now that we've created a
maintenance request let's see how to
manage them to do that I'll navigate to
the maintenance
application and here I can see all the
to-do or scheduled requests from a
specific team by clicking the to-do
buttons I can also see every request
regardless of the assigned team by
clicking on maintenance and then
maintenance requests and doing so shows
the selected request in a can band view
this view works the same as most other
can band views in ODU so I'm not going
to go into too much detail about that
but there is one specific maintenance
option that I will mention and if I
click the gear icon of a specific stage
and then click on edit I can see there's
a request confirmed option if this is
enabled I can move a maintenance request
for a work center to this stage the work
center will be blocked for a duration
that's specified on the request
form finally I want to show you another
way how to manage maintenance requests
and that's through the maintenance
calendar which I can navigate to
maintenance and then maintenance
calendar once again and the calendar
shows me all of my scheduled requests
and I can reschedule any of them simply
by dragging and dropping them to another
date or time if I click on that specific
request I am shown all of its key
details and I can also delete or edit
this to open its form and that's all
I've got for you today folks if you've
made it all the way to the end of this
video you now know how to create and
manage maintenance requests thanks for
sticking around and I'll see you next
time
