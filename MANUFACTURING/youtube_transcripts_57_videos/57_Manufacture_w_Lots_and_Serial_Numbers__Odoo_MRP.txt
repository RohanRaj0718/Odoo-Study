What's going on o doers? Nathan here.
Today we're diving into one of the most
powerful traceability features used
across manufacturing, inventory, and
quality control. Lots and serial
numbers. In manufacturing, accurate
traceability is crucial at every stage
from production to storage to final
delivery. Serial numbers allow you to
track each finished unit individually
through the entire process, ensuring
complete visibility for every item that
comes off the production line. Lots, on
the other hand, allow you to track
groups of products produced or received
together, making them ideal for
batch-based manufacturing where items
don't require individual identifiers.
Whether you're producing large batches
or assigning unique serial numbers to
every unit, ODO gives you the tools to
manage traceability with precision and
ease. So, let's hop into our database
and see how this works. All right, we're
kicking things off on the main ODO
dashboard. Before we start working with
lotser serial numbers, we first need to
make sure the proper settings are
enabled. So, we're going to head over to
the settings app and on the left
sidebar, we're going to click inventory.
Then, we're just going to scroll down
till we find the traceability section.
Oh, there it is. And you'll see an
option for lots and serial numbers. Go
ahead and make sure that box is ticked.
And one quick reminder, if you're
enabling this setting for the very first
time, don't forget to click save before
moving on. Now that our lots and serial
number settings are enabled, we're going
to take a look at how we actually
configure products to actually use them.
Here on our manufacturing dashboard,
we're going to head up to products and
select products once again, and we're
going to select our luxury office chair.
Inside the product form, we're going to
take a look at our general information
tab. Here you'll find the track
inventory field which determines how the
product will be tracked through your
operations. You'll see when we open up
this drop-own menu, we have three
different options. We have track by
quantity, by lots, and by unique serial
number.
For this example, we're manufacturing
and tracking this product with serial
numbers, which means every finished
product will be assigned its own unique
identifier. Once you've selected your
tracking method, we're ready to start
manufacturing.
To create a manufacturing order for our
luxury office chair, we're just going to
click operations at the top, followed by
manufacturing orders. And then we'll
click new in the top left corner. On the
MO, I'll add our luxury office chair.
And I'm also going to update the
quantity to 10 since that's how many we
need to produce. Once everything looks
correct, I'll click confirm.
And at this stage, we can either assign
serial numbers through this generate
serial button or we can click produce
all.
Once we click produce all, this assign
serial numbers popup will appear. Here
you can enter your own serial numbers or
let ODO generate them for you. When
generating serial numbers, ODO
automatically fills in the first serial
number with the next available serial
number for that product. However, if you
prefer to start with a different number,
you can manually update that here.
However, this looks good though, so I'll
click generate followed by apply.
And now to fully complete this MO, we'll
click produce all. And as soon as this
MO is completed, you'll notice there's a
traceability smart button that appears
at the top. When we click that smart
button, it opens a full traceability
report for every serial number that we
just produced. And here on the right, we
can see the full product journey. In
this case, we can see the serial number
started in production and they are now
in our warehouse stock. Manufacturing
with serial numbers is pretty
straightforward, right? The good news is
that manufacturing with lots is even
easier. So, let's take a look at how
that works. As we can see, our cable
management box is tracked by lots. Just
like our previous example, we'll click
operations at the top, followed by
manufacturing orders, and then click
new. In the product field, we're just
going to add our cable management box.
And in the quantity field, we're going
to enter 10 and then confirm.
Now, all we have to do is click produce
all to complete the MO. And once it's
finished, you'll notice that a lot
number has been automatically assigned
to the entire batch. And that's it.
Today we checked out how to configure
products for tracking, walked through
manufacturing with serial numbers, and
then we just saw how easy it is to
handle batches with lot numbers. ODU
takes care of assigning and organizing
everything for you. And the traceability
views make it super simple to follow
each product's journey from production
all the way to stock. Whether you're
dealing with unique items or bulk
batches, the whole process stays clean,
clear, and easy to manage. Thanks for
watching, Odoers, and I'll see you in
the next video.
