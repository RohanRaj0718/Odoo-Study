welcome back oo doers or should I say
welcome back orders because that's
exactly what we'll be talking about
today you see whenever we create a new
manufacturing order ormo using OD
manufacturing app we need to specify the
quantity that we want to manufacture
however when it actually comes time to
process Theo we may want to manufacture
only a portion of the specified product
quantity while worrying about the rest
at a later date luckily we can do just
that using the back orders feature in
odo's manufacturing app this allows us
to split the Emos into two smaller Emos
the firsto is processed immediately
while the second back order or Mo gets
processed at a later date this provides
manufacturing employees with more
flexibility when managing MOS so let's
jump into our Odo database now to see
how this all works all right here we are
on the manufacturing app dashboard if
you've watched any of our previous
manufacturing tutorials and I sure hope
you have have you'll know the first
thing we need to do is create a new ml
so to do that I'm going to click on
operations at the top followed by
manufacturing orders and then we're
going to select new in the upper leftand
corner now today we'll be manufacturing
our chair product for this tutorial so
let's go ahead and select that in the
product
field and before we confirm this MMO I
need to decide how many chairs we want
to manufacture let's say it's the
beginning of the workday and I think I
can complete five whole chairs it's a
bit ambitious but hey I'm feeling pretty
limber today so I'm going to go ahead
and enter five in the quantity field
here and then click confirm on the Mo's
top now on the bottom of the MMO if we
click on the work orders tab I can see
that manufacturing each chair requires
two different work orders first we have
cut the wood followed by assemble the
chair so let's hop over to our shop
floor module now to start processing
these work
orders on the shop floor dashboard I see
a card for Theo that I just created if I
click into the saw
station this opens a page for that work
center where our first work order is
scheduled to be carried out now let's
say halfway through the workday I've
only completed the cut work order for
four of the five chairs that we need
I'll need the rest of the day to just
assemble those four so it looks like I
won't be able to complete all five
chairs today seems that my eyes were
bigger than my capacity for chair
production oh well I'll just go ahead
and complete this work order for the
four chairs right now and normally I
would click on the five units button
here to confirm that all five work units
have been completed instead I'm going to
click on this register production button
and enter the quantity of four in the
quantity produced field then I'll click
validate now I'll go ahead and complete
the work order by clicking on the mark
As done button and when I do the work
order disappears in the next work order
assemble chair appears at assembly line
one now there are a couple of things I
want to point out here first the work
orders card is titled with original Mo
number followed by a 001 tag added to
the end of it this confirms that the
emmo has been split into two and that
this work order belongs to the first of
the two new Emos now on the register
production line we can see that this
work order is for four units of the
chair since that's how many we finished
during the previous work order now if I
go ahead and refresh my page here we're
taken back to the shop dashboard where
both of the newos appear Additionally
the first work order of the secondo now
appears at the saw
station we can also see that this work
order only contains one single unit
remaining and all of this is confirmed
on the Emo's back end as well so if I go
back to the first emmo
click on the gear icon and then click on
the open manufacturing orders for the
001
tag here we can see that the quantity of
this emmo is
44 and if I click into the work orders
tab we can see that there are zero
quantities remaining for the first work
order and the second has four remaining
the back order emmo is linked to this
emmo by the back order smart button at
the top of the page
from this page I'll select the emmo with
the 002 tag at the end of
it and on thiso we can see the quantity
is set to one and on the work orders tab
it looks like we have both work orders
remaining for
each all right now let's just say I
finished lunched and I'm ready to
complete the second work order for the
four chairs in our first ml we're going
to head back to our shop floor dashboard
and then click on the assembly line one
button at the top of the
page and then click our card for our
firsto now all I have to do is Click
Mark is done to complete the work order
and then close production to confirm
that the four chairs have been
manufactured few that was quite a day I
didn't get as much done as I wanted but
four chairs is no small manufacturing
order now when I return to work tomorrow
and open our shop floor module I'll be
able to see the back order Mo waiting
for me to complete and that brings us to
the close of what I'm sure you can agree
was another amazing video today we
learned how to create and process back
order manufacturing orders using the
manufacturing app and Shop floor module
thanks for sticking around and I'll see
you next time
