================================================================================

what's up o doers today we're talking
about Alternatives alternative work
centers that is you see larger
manufacturing operations often require
multiple work centers that can process
the same type of work order this allows
for a work order to be rerouted to an
alternative work center in the case that
the main work center is busy or blocked
for any other reason by doing so we're
able to process work orders more quickly
preventing them from piling up at a
single work center let's jump into our
database to see how it
works all right I'll begin by clicking
on configuration and then down to work
centers here I can see every Works
Center I've created as you can see I've
already got a few including one assembly
line titled assembly line one now
recently we've been having a backup of
work orders at this work center so we've
decided to create a second assembly line
that can also process them I'll
configure it an Odo Now by clicking on
the new button in the upper leand corner
and I'll start by entering assembly line
two
as the work Center's name I also need to
give this work center a code to
distinguish it from the other work
centers the code at our first assembly
line is ASL one so let's enter
asl2 as the code of this work center I'm
also going to add the assembly tag in
the tag field to make it easier to find
this work center when we're trying to
see all of our assembly lines the last
field I need to worry about in this
section is the alternative work centers
field this field is where we declare
which other work centers can accept to
work orders that this particular work
center might be unable to handle I'll
select assembly line one from this
dropdown and now if this assembly line 2
work center is too busy or inoperative
clicking the plan button on a
manufacturing order will reroute its
work orders to assembly line one
instead I'm also going to select this
work center assembly line two as the
alternative for assembly line one but
first let's take a look at the equipment
tab this is where we specified the
equipment required for this work center
to function F when configurating
alternative work centers it's essential
that each work center is configured with
the same equipment this ensures an
operation carried out at one work center
can also be carried out at the others
for example it would be really
inconvenient if we try to start a work
order at our saw station and instead of
finding a table saw the only work center
that was equipped with a
orange at our assembly line the only
piece of equipment we need is the power
drill I'll add the drill to this work
center by clicking add a line
selecting our power drill in the
checkbox and in the resulting popup
window I'll just click
select all right that's all we need to
configure for this work center before we
move on I'm going to return to the work
Center Page by clicking on configuration
and then work centers once again we're
going to click on assembly line one and
add assembly line two in the alternative
work centers
field you should to also notice that on
the general information tab below here
this work centers capacity is set as one
this means it can only process one
product at a time for more information
about work Center capacity as well some
of the other settings that you're seeing
on this page here check out our work
center parameters
video now if I go back to the work
center page through the breadcrumbs you
can see in the alternative work centers
column that assembly line one and
assembly line two have each
other all right we're all set to use our
work centers to manufacture some
products for this example let's manual
facture a couple of units of our chair
we'll start by looking at the products
build materials and we can access that
by clicking on products and then build
materials and then we're going to select
our chair
product if I click on the operations tab
here we can see that the manufacturing
has one step which is our assemble
operation which is carry it out at
assembly line one now let's go ahead and
create a manufacturing order or M Mo for
that chair and to do that we're going to
select on operations and select on
manufacturing orders select new in the
upper leftand corner and we're just
going to add chair to our product field
and then all we have to do is click on
confirm then when I click on the work
orders tab where I can see our assemble
operation is as expected it's scheduled
to be processed at assembly line one so
I'll go ahead and just click Start on
this and since our assembly line one
work center has a capacity of one this
work center is now at capacity until the
work order is completed so let's go
ahead and create an an identical emmo by
clicking on this gear icon here and
selecting duplicate and then just like
the same time before I'm going to hit
confirm as you can see in the work
centers tab assembly line one is still
scheduled however if I click on the plan
button here at the top of Theo the
column updates to assembly line two with
the work orders for thato scheduled at
different work centers were now able to
process them simultaneously and take
full advantage of our assembly line
facilities and that's all I've got for
you today folks thanks for sticking
around and I'll see you next time
