Hello Odooers, and welcome back!
Do you know what I really love?  
Making cool products for cool people, even 
when it isn’t exactly a “best seller.” For  
those types of products, we tend to 
use a manufacturing route known as,  
Make-to-order. Let me explain what that means.
See… Here at Stealthy Wood, we keep most products  
on hand at all times, like our basic wooden 
tables, for example. They’re super popular  
and customers order them all the time.
But, some customers have more unique  
tastes. Take little Margo here… she wants one of 
our S-shaped tables. She’s one of the “cool” ones. 
However, that particular item isn’t exactly 
“flying off the shelves,” so we don’t actually  
keep them on hand in our warehouse.
For products like this, we’ve enabled  
a route called Replenish on order, or 
Make-to-Order. That means when “Cool  
Margo’s” order is confirmed, Odoo triggers 
a replenishment order to source the product. 
That can take shape as either a Manufacturing 
Order or a Purchase Order, depending on how  
you set up that product’s form.
Once the product is available,  
you can fulfill the customer’s order. And 
it’s worth noting that the replenishment  
occurs even if there is enough stock on hand.
In this video, I’ll show you how to configure  
an MTO route, and walk through what happens 
when a customer orders a product that you do  
not have on hand. So, let’s get started!
Alrighty, before we get going, you should  
know that, by default, the MTO route in Odoo is 
archived. This is because not every manufacturer  
uses it. So, for our demonstration today, we 
need to unarchive it, which is super easy to do. 
To do that, we’ll first go to the Inventory 
app, click on the Configuration subheading,  
and select on Warehouses.
From here, we’ll select our  
main Stealthy Wood warehouse, and let's go 
ahead and click on the Routes smart button at  
the top. This will show us all the routes 
available for this particular warehouse. 
To find the MTO route, we’ll need to select the 
Archived filter, by clicking the downward arrow  
next to the Search bar, and let's go ahead 
and select ‘Archived’ in the Filters section. 
And just like that, the MTO route pops 
up! Now, let's go ahead and select the  
MTO route by clicking on the checkbox next to 
the route, and let's go ahead and go to the  
“Actions” button here at the top, and let's 
select “Unarchive” from the drop-down menu. 
Now, let’s go ahead and remove the Archived 
filter from the search bar. And voila! We  
now have access to the MTO route in all our 
manufacturing processes. See, I told ya it  
was easy! Next, let’s set MTO as the route for 
our S-Shaped Tables. Like I mentioned before,  
we don’t sell this product very often so we 
don’t keep it in-stock. However, I’ve already  
set up a bill of materials to use for when we 
do need to manufacture it for an MTO order. 
To get this process going, let's go ahead and 
navigate to the Products subheading, and click  
on Products. And you’ll notice we have 0 units of 
our S-Shaped Table on hand. So, let’s select the  
S-Shaped Table to check on a couple things.
On the product form, let's go ahead and  
click on the Inventory tab, and under the 
Operations section, we have our Routes,  
including Replenish on Order (MTO). So, 
let’s go ahead and click the box next to it. 
Keep in mind that MTO always needs to be 
paired with another route - either Buy,  
Manufacture, or Resupply Subcontractor, 
if that option is available. So it won’t  
do anything when it is selected on its own.
Alright, since we’re manufacturing this product,  
and not purchasing it from a vendor, I 
want to make sure the box next to Buy is  
not checked. And we want to make sure the 
box next to Manufacture is checked. So it  
should look like a checkbox sandwich.
Okay, now, let’s see what happens when  
Cool Margo orders an S-Shaped Table! 
For that, let’s go into the Sales app,  
and Create a New Quotation, by clicking on ‘New.’
On the quotation form, we’ll enter “Cool Margo”  
as the Customer, and then we’ll add 
1 S-Shaped Table to the quotation. 
Alrighty, let’s go ahead and Confirm the 
sales order. Odoo automatically triggers  
the Make-to-Order replenishment rule, 
which creates a Manufacturing order,  
which is represented by the Manufacturing 
smart button that appears at the top. 
Also, if we click this graph icon on the 
Order Line, we'll see that there are currently  
0 S-Shaped Tables available. That’s 
where the MTO route comes into play. 
Ok, let’s go ahead and click on the 
Manufacturing smart button at the top.  
This brings us directly to the corresponding 
manufacturing order for this table. 
Okay, let's go ahead and go into the 
MO’s Miscellaneous tab, and we can  
see that the source document for this MO is 
the sales order we just processed. Perfect! 
Now, we could jump into the Shop Floor module 
to manufacture this table, but I'll go ahead  
and do it here on the MO to save us some time. 
To do that, we'll click on the Work Orders tab,  
where we’ll see the two operations that go 
into making this S-Shaped Table. One is,  
“Assemble the table,” and two is, “Apply veneer.”
Let’s go ahead and click Start on the first  
work order - Assemble the Table. That begins a 
timer. Once I’ve finished working on this step,  
I’ll go ahead and click Done. And we’ll see 
that the status of that work order has changed  
to “Finished.” Okay, now let's go ahead and do the 
same for the next step. I’ll click Start and once  
I'm finished, I'll click Done. Awesome!
Now that I’ve finished all the steps,  
I’ll click Produce All in the top-left 
corner to finish manufacturing the table. 
Now, if I click on the smart button at the top 
for Sale, it’ll take me back to the sales order,  
and let’s go ahead and click 
on the graph icon again. Now,  
I can see the quantity has changed from 0 
to 1, because I’ve manufactured the table,  
and Odoo now recognizes that it is 
in stock and ready to ship. Awesome! 
We’re almost at the end here Odooers. All we 
need to do is to process the delivery. For that,  
I’ll go to the delivery order by clicking 
the Delivery smart button at the top,  
and we’ll click Validate to complete the delivery. 
And there you have it! You just learned how the  
MTO route automates the creation of manufacturing 
orders directly from a sales order, streamlining  
the workflow for make-to-order products.
Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you next time!
