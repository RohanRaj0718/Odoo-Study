================================================================================

Hello Odooers, and welcome back! Sometimes, things 
just break, and we have to fix them. Items we ship  
might get damaged in transit, or a purchased 
product might break while still under warranty. 
From a manufacturing standpoint, it’s super 
important to offer services after a sale has  
happened, since we want to maintain a good 
reputation in the market and build strong  
relationships with our customers.
Offering efficient repairs adds a  
touch of excellence to our customer 
service offerings, and encourages  
people to continue buying products from us.
In Odoo, the Repairs application integrates  
beautifully with the Manufacturing, Inventory, 
and Helpdesk applications. By activating a few  
settings, we can swiftly take care of any 
repairs and keep our customers happy. So,  
let’s dive right in and see how we can manage 
the repair process in Odoo! Before we begin,  
let’s take a look at the product we’ll be using 
today, a Customized Desk made of glass. So let's  
go to the Sales Application, go to the Products 
Subheading, and click on Products. And let’s click  
on the Customized Desk product. This brings us to 
the product form. Let’s go to the Inventory tab,  
and under “Traceability", w see that tracking 
‘by unique serial number’ has been selected. This  
is important, because we’ll need to track our 
products in order to process repair orders. To  
enable tracking by serial numbers, you’ll need to 
activate the setting from the Inventory app first,  
so make sure you do that before starting the 
flow. Alright, let’s start our flow from the  
very beginning, and sell the product to 
our customer before we tackle repairs. 
Since we’re already in the Sales app, we'll go to 
the Orders subheading, and click on Quotations.  
And would you look at that, we already have a 
new quotation here for Joey! Let’s click into  
it. It looks like Joey ordered one Customized Desk 
made of glass. Under the Optional Products tab,  
we also offer a Warranty as a cross sell if the 
customer wants that extra layer of security. In  
this case, let’s say that Joey decided to take the 
risk and forgo the warranty. I hope that doesn't  
bite him in the gl-ass table later. Get it? So, 
let’s go ahead and confirm this quotation. That  
turns it into a sales older, all ready to deliver.
We'll click into the Delivery smart button here at  
the top, click Validate, Mark All Done, and 
boom! It's as easy as that Odooers. And check  
this out – on the product line, in the Serial 
Numbers column, an existing serial number was  
automatically chosen for this specific desk 
that Joey ordered. Keep that number in mind,  
you'll need to remember it for later!
Okay, so it’s been quite some time and our  
customer reported a problem with the 
desk and is requesting a repair. Not a  
problem! Stealthy Wood takes great pride 
in the awesome after-sales services and  
everything is easily managed using the Odoo 
Helpdesk application. So jump into Helpdesk! 
Here, I have a dedicated team set up to address 
all issues related to furniture. Right now,  
we need to activate some important configurations 
for our Helpdesk team, which we can access by  
clicking on these three dots on the top right of 
the Customer Care card. And let’s choose Settings.  
Let’s go ahead and scroll to the very bottom to 
the After-Sales heading. We can see that Returns  
and Repairs checked for this Helpdesk team. This 
will allow us to integrate our Helpdesk flow with  
the Inventory and Repairs applications. For 
more information on After-Sales Services,  
be sure to check out the Helpdesk tutorial we 
have for that subject. Alright, let’s head back  
to Helpdesk Overview via the breadcrumbs. Let’s 
imagine that our client submitted a ticket on our  
website requesting a repair service – we can see 
in our Customer Care card overview that we have  
1 unassigned ticket. Let’s go ahead and check it 
out. This leads us to a ticket generated from the  
customer service form with the Title of the ticket 
as the Subject of the form, and the description  
of the form as the description of the ticket. 
Okay, let’s go ahead and assign this ticket to  
Mitchell Admin. For the priority, let's select 
3 stars because we value Joey as a customer! For  
the type Type, let's select “Issue”. And for 
the tags, let's do “Website”. After reviewing  
the customer's complaint, the first thing our 
Helpdesk team needs to do is specify the product  
on the ticket. So let’s click the Return button 
above the form on the top left. This will reveal  
a pop-up window where we can see the appropriate 
desk and appropriate sales order are linked. Let’s  
go ahead and change the quantity to 1. And let's 
click Return to confirm this return. Awesome! An  
important piece of information that the client 
needs to provide the product’s serial number. We  
can track the exact product we sold, which we can 
find, by clicking on the blue Details icon on the  
product line under the Serial Numbers column. 
And would you look at that, Odooers – remember  
the serial number I asked you to remember, 
from Joey’s sales order? Well, here it is now,  
this time on the Return form! Great, everything’s 
checking out so far! So let’s go ahead and click  
discard for now. Now, let's dive a little deeper 
into Joey's customer profile by clicking on this  
arrow next to Joey’s name. And let's head to 
the Sales smart button at the top. And let's  
check out the original Sales Order to see to see 
if the desk was purchased with a warranty or not. 
In the product lines, we see that the 
original sale was made without warranty. 
Too bad for Joey.
So, let’s go back to the  
Helpdesk ticket using the breadcrumbs.
I'll click on the 3 dots at the top  
left and click on "Issue with Desk (#57)".
And let's reply to the customer by using the  
Send message chatter function. We can ask if the 
customer is willing to pay for the repair, since  
they didn’t originally purchase a warranty with 
the product. To do that, we’ll type a colon, this  
brings up a list of canned responses that we can 
choose from. Let’s choose the one that says “no  
warranty” and click Send. Isn’t that easy Odooers? 
In addition to chatting with the customer, we can  
use the chatter to collect important details from 
the customer once the return order is validated,  
like the product’s serial number, and 
the original delivery slip information. 
Now, let’s say we sent our message to Joey, 
he had some time to think about it, and he’s  
willing to pay for the repair out-of-pocket. So 
he’s gonna send the table back to us for repairs. 
So, two things need to happen: , the customer 
needs to return the product back to us. Then,  
we can begin working on repairs. Let’s process the 
return by clicking the Return smart button at the  
top of the form. Now, since we confirmed earlier 
that this is the correct desk he wants to return,  
we see more information here. Okay, 
let’s click Validate and Mark All Done. 
Okay, let’s go back to the Helpdesk ticket 
via the breadcrumbs. And here, we canI see  
that the return is logged in the chatter as 
“Done”. If we want to double check the return,  
we can do so by heading back into the dashboard, 
hopping into the Inventory app, clicking on the  
Operations subheading, and then Receipts. And at 
the bottom over here, we see the Return of our  
original delivery, from Joey. Awesome! And that’s 
how you process returns for products previously  
delivered to customers! In the next video on 
Repairs, we'll learn how to physically repair  
and re-deliver the item once it’s been returned. 
Thanks for watching, Odooers. See you next time!
