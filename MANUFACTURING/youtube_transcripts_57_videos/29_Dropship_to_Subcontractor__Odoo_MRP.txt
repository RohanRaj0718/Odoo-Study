================================================================================

welcome back o doers my name is Jasio
today I've got another subcontracting
video for you this time we're going to
be taking a look at drop ship
subcontractor on order route which
allows us to supply a subcontractor with
components by having a vendor drop ship
them you see sometimes we want to send a
subcontractor components without even
possessing them ourselves in that type
of situation we can purchase them from a
vendor and then have them shipped
directly to the subcontractor this
benefits us because we don't have to
worry about the cost of receiving and
storing the components once the
subcontractor receives everything they
need they manufacture the product as
usual and ship it to us so enough
chitchat let's jump in and see how it
all works so once again we're going to
be starting with configuration now I've
already covered all of the general
subcontracting settings in the basic
subcontracting video so be sure to watch
that one if you haven't already I'm also
going to make sure to link that below so
inside of this video I'm just going to
go over over the specific configuration
settings to the drop ship subcontractor
on order route so first off we need to
open up the bomb for the product of this
example which happens to be a bicycle so
to do that I'm going to head on over to
the inventory application and then we're
going to select the word products and
products now remember what did I say
we're looking for a bicycle perfect so
once that we're inside of here at the
top of this page we select the smart
button for bill of materials perfect
select the bicycle one and there we are
now if you watch the basic sub
Contracting video you'll know that we
don't need to add components to a bomb
for a product manufactured using that
workflow however in this case we are
responsible for supplying the
subcontractor with components and need
to list them on the bomb as you can see
on our components tab over here I've
added the components needed to
manufacture the bike which happens to be
a frame and a wheel well quantity to CU
you need two wheels on a bike now let's
go to the product page for in our case
the frame so we can actually SEL the
internal link right there and takes us
right there so you'll notice inside of
the purchase tab over here we happen to
have a vendor bike World along with the
price that they are selling this to us
which is $50 as well as a delivery lead
time over here now this is the vendor
that will send the components to our
subcontractor once we purchase them next
let's click back over here to this
inventory tab so here inside of the
routes as you guessed it I've selected
the drop ship subcontractor on order
route and that's what we need with this
route selected every time we confirm a
purchase order or PO for the bicycle
over there a request for quotation or
RFQ for my acronym lovers will be
generated to purchase the component from
the vendor and then have a drop ship to
the subcontractor all right I've already
configured our wheel component in the
same way so let's move on to the drop
chip subcontractor workflow wow that is
a
mouthful so the first thing that we need
to do is to create a purchase order to
buy a bicycle from our subcontractor so
I'm actually going to go out of here and
we're going to open up our handy dandy
purchase application right there and
inside of here we're going to select on
the word orders up at the top and you
guessed it purchase orders and now we're
going to select new over here in the top
left okay so on the new purchase order
I'm going to add the bicycle vendor
which happens to be bike friends it's
kind of nice so that goes inside of our
vender field then I need to add the
bicycle down on the product tab so add a
product down here we're going to select
the bicycle okay great we're moving
pretty fast right here everything looks
good so I'm going to confirm our order
over here in the top and then a couple
of things have just happened first a
receipt smart button has appeared up in
the top Center and then second an RFQ is
generated to purchase the bicycle's
components from the vendor however the
RFQ is not linked to the PO by a smart
button this is one of the key
differences between the drop ship
subcontractor on order and the resupply
subcontractor on order routes when a PO
is confirmed for a product that uses the
resupply subcontractor on order route a
resupply smart button appears
automatically at the top of this page
however when using Dropship
subcontractor on order the smart button
does not appear right away instead the
vendor RFQ must first be confirmed which
creates a drop ship order to send the
components from the vendor to the
subcontractor at that point a resupply
smart button appears on the
subcontractor purchase order which opens
the drop ship order when when clicked I
know that's a bit confusing so let me
show you what I mean so we're going to
start by clicking on orders once again
and then inside of here remember it's an
RFQ so request for quotation right there
now we need to select the one that was
just created so we'll usually find this
as the main one up at the very top right
there perfect now before we confirm it
let's take a look at a few things first
we can see our component vendor which
happens to be Bike World and that's
already listed in the Bender field right
there in the deliver to field over here
here you'll notice it says Dropship
subcontractor and bike friends is listed
for the drop ship address it's kind of
important because finally inside of our
products tab it lists all of our
components which happens to be the frame
and the wheels altogether this
information tells us that bike world
will drop Shi a frame and two wheels to
bike friends so let's confirm this right
now by selecting right there and let's
see what happens when we do that so what
do you know as I had just stated a
Dropship smart button appears at the top
of the page when we click the drop ship
smart button over here it opens up the
drop ship order so once that the vendor
has sent the components to the
subcontractor all we need to do is Click
validate up here at the top of the order
now the subcontractor has everything
they need to start manufacturing the
bicycle before we move on there's just
one more thing I want to show you on the
drop ship order so up at the very top of
the page let's click on the source Po
and that's a little smart button right
there there we go back over here to our
subcontractor po remember how I said a
resupply smart buone would appear after
we confirmed the vendor RFQ well what do
you know o doers it's right there up at
the top of the page clicking it takes us
right back to the Dropship order that we
just came from so once the subcontractor
manufactures the bicycle and ships it
back to us we need to process the
receipt to enter it into our inventory
to do so I can either click on the
receipt smart button which happens to be
at the top of the page or the received
products and remember that will only
happen after you have validated these
types of things and it's perfect either
option opens up the receipts then I just
have to click that validate button that
you just saw me talk about and the
bicycle will be entered so once that we
do all of that it's all done we're done
today I showed you how to configure a
product that happens to use the drop
ship subcontractor on an order route you
now know how to supply a subcontractor
with components without ever having
having to handle them yourself and
that's pretty nifty right that's it for
today I'm going to see you next time
