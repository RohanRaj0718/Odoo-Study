================================================================================

welcome back OD doers in our last lesson
we took a look at all the bells and
whistles of the brand new shop floor
module now today we're going to put that
lesson into practice how you may ask
well I'm going to show you how to
process a manufacturing order Oro for my
acronym lovers using the shop floor as
we just learned the shop floor module
makes it easy to process multiple MOS
even if eacho has multiple work orders
within it it does this by grouping work
orders based on the work center where
they're actually carried out all right
I'm hyped up so let's make a coffee
table so before we get started let's
take a quick look at the product that
we're going to be making now to do that
I'm going to jump inside of the
manufacturing app go up here to products
and products now we're going to select
that coffee table and select that bill
of materials smart button up at the top
and then click on the first one all
right now I've already configured a Bild
of materials or bomb for this product
because you need to remember that every
product we manufacture must have at
least one bomb otherwise we wouldn't
know how to make it all right now on the
bomb we have all of our components
listed inside of the components tab that
we have right there and if I click into
the operations tab over here we can see
that there are two operations required
to manufacture our coffee table we have
assemble table and stain the table now
the stain table operation as you can
tell is actually blocked by the assemble
table operation which means we need to
assemble the table before we can stain
it additionally if you look over towards
the instructions column over here we can
actually notice that there are multiple
steps to complete complete I can
actually view all of the required steps
by clicking on the show instructions
button which happens to look like these
little lines with the dots so let's
click on the one for assemble table over
here for example this one actually
requires three steps to complete we have
inspecting attaching legs and adding the
Shelf as well so to sum it all up we
have our coffee table product along with
its bomb the bomb itself has two
operations required to manufacture the
table and each of those operations is
further broken down into multiple steps
oh my God it's all complicated right and
all of that is required to manufacture
just a single product imagine when you
have dozens no hundreds of products that
you need to manufacture each with
multiple operations and steps well the
good news is that the shop module was
designed for exactly that problem so
let's jump into it now so I can show you
how it can simplify everything for us
all right first off we need to create a
manufacturing order for our coffee table
so we're going to make a way to
operations and Manufacturing orders
select new and type in that coffee table
over here in conf firm it out all right
will you want to make a quick note of
this actual MMO number that we have up
here at the top and that's so that we
can easily distinguish it from otheros
in the shop floor module and since we're
using two-step manufacturing for this
workflow a pick components order is
automatically created to transfer the
required components to the production
location this is also true for
three-step manufacturing I can actually
access the picking order by clicking on
the transfer smart button that
automatically appeared up here at the
top now once the components have been
transferred I just need to valid
validate this Mark all is done and we're
all set and this is so that we can
confirm everything has occurred now
completing the picking order for the
ammo is important because it marks the
ammo as ready to start by default the
shop floor app only shows emos that are
ready to start if you're using one step
manufacturing no picking order is
required and a confirmed ammo will be
ready to start as long as the required
components are available inside of your
inventory now I can actually head over
to the shop floor application over here
and like I talked about
since it replaced the tablet view the
shoper module has its own dedicated icon
on the Odo dashboard that you saw me use
now on the actual module homepage over
here there's a card for our coffee table
emmo which we can easily find by
searching for that emmo with that copied
text that I showed you earlier now that
makes it a lot easier now this card list
the first war order we need to complete
which happens to be assembled table
along with a button to take me to the
work center where it will be carried out
which happens happens to be the assembly
line over here perfect now on the page
for our assembly line work center Theo
number filter remains in the search bar
so we only see the work order for that
Mo if I remove that filter we would see
every work order assigned to this work
center but I'm not feeling chaotic today
so I'm just going to leave it as is so
we can focus on this specific work order
that we have right there all right let's
start manufacturing our coffee table
first off I'm going to click on the
header that says assemble table over
here and there's a reason for that boom
it starts the timer over here this timer
keeps track of the time spent working on
the work order this information can be
viewed later on Theo along with the
total cost to process the work order
we'll talk about how to basically see
that info in a later video then I'm
going to complete the steps one by one
to do so I'll click on the first step
which is inspect
components okay now this one in this
case it's a past fail quality check that
requires me to inspect our components
for defects thankfully looking at our
metaphorical not real table over here it
passes great now we can move on to the
next step so we'll hit next over here
and we're going to keep going through
this alternatively I can close this out
and I can click on the little check
boxes that we have over here to finish
them all off which I just did for the
last part over here great with all the
steps completed I'll click on Mark is
done over here and that causes the
assemble table work order to fade away
as that's happening take a look up at
the paint station that we have over here
and this work center at the moment said
zero and that's because there's nothing
assigned to it right now however once
the previous work order disappears
completely ah look at that I love it
when that happens boom there's now one
work order assigned to the paint station
this is because ODU recognizes that the
next work order stain table is finally
ready for processing so we're going to
click on that paint station over there
and it's time to complete all the steps
for the same table work order now once I
do that by once again clicking on all of
this stuff all over again we can
actually close production because the
button appears since this was the final
work order for the ammo once I click it
the ammo itself is completed and the
work order starts to fade away Death
Leopard said it you know it's better to
burn out than fade away but in this case
the work order fading away means we've
produced a brand new coffee table if
that's not rock and roll I don't know
what is well that's it for today oo
doers don't worry though this won't be
the last time that we talk about the
shop module so stay tuned grab a snack
listen to some Death
