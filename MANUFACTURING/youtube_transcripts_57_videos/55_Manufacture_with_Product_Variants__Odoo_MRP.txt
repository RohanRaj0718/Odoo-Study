================================================================================

What's up, Odoers, and welcome back. At
Stealthywood, we're known for our
ergonomic chairs, and our customers
appreciate having options. We give them
three different colors to choose from,
plus the ability to add a comfortable
headrest or not. And hey, that sounds
perfect, right? But behind the scenes,
all that customization creates a complex
challenge. Each combination, like a
black chair with a headrest or a red
chair without one, becomes its own mini
product. And suddenly, our manufacturing
team isn't just building one chair.
They're juggling six different versions.
Each one needs a specific parts list
because different colors mean different
components to track. Each one might also
follow a different set of steps on the
assembly line, like adding a headrest or
skipping it. And with more product
variants, you get more SKs, more
inventory to manage, and more room for
mistakes. As the manufacturing manager
here at Stealthy Wood, I deal with this
every day. And when a new order comes
in, let's say a blue chair without a
headrest, I don't have to scramble
because ODU automatically picks the
right build of materials, the correct
components, and the proper steps on the
shop floor. No second guessing, no
manual edits, no delays, just smooth,
accurate production. In this video,
we're going to walk through the process
of ordering a chair variant so you can
see exactly how ODU keeps production
running smoothly, even with multiple
options. That being said, let's dive in.
Before we dive into manufacturing, just
a quick heads up, we've already enabled
and configured product variance. To turn
products variance on, we just need to
hop into our settings, click sales in
our left side column, and then here
under our product catalog section, make
sure we have variance ticked and
enabled. And if you haven't done this in
your database yet, don't forget to click
save before moving on. But now that
that's out of the way, let's take a look
at the ergonomic chair that we'll be
building today. We're going to hop into
the manufacturing app, select products,
followed by products once again, and
select our ergonomic chair.
Currently, the product type is set to
goods. And we've also enabled track
inventory.
And this is both on for not only the
chair, but the components as well. And
that's so we know exactly what's in
stock before we even start production.
If we move over to our attributes and
variance tab, you'll see the two
different options we have here. We have
our headrest attribute with our yes and
no values. And we also have our color
attribute with black, red, and blue
being the color options.
That gives us six different possible
combinations for our ergonomic chair.
Now, let's take a look at how components
change based on the chair color. First,
I'm going to click our build material
smart button here at the top of the
screen. And I'm just going to open our
first build materials here for our black
chair with a headrest.
And we've linked this bomb to this
specific product variant.
Under the components, we're going to see
we have our headrest since this variant
does include our yes value. And it also
includes our black chair base as well as
our black armrest which matches the
configuration.
Now, we're going to head back to our
bill material list using the breadcrumbs
at the top. And this time, let's go
ahead and select our red chair without a
headrest.
In here, we'll notice a few different
things. There's no headrest component
and our chair base and armrest is red.
And if we look back at the product
variant field here, we can see our
selected configuration here.
Each bomb reflects exactly what that
variant needs, nothing more and nothing
less. Now, let's walk through a full
flow using one specific product variant.
And we're going to sell and manufacture
a black ergonomic chair with a headrest.
So to get started, we're going to head
back to our homepage here and just
quickly jump into the sales app. I'll
click new in the top left corner. We'll
choose Deco Addict as our customer and
we're going to click add a product at
the bottom and add our ergonomic chair.
When we do, a pop-up appears and this is
where we can select our product
attributes. In this case, we're going to
keep the default options, which is yes
to the headrest and keep the color set
to black. If we wanted to remove the
headrest, we could simply just click no.
And when we do, we'll also see the price
drop automatically. That's because we
added a $50 upcharge to the headrest
option.
And we can change this back by clicking
yes. And we'll also see the price
automatically update.
Next, we just have to click confirm on
the popup and then confirm again on the
quotation, which then turns it into an
official sales order.
Once it's confirmed, a manufacturing
order is created. And that's because the
product route is on replenish to order
or manufacture.
And from here, we're just going to click
this manufacturing smart button.
And that takes us straight to the
manufacturing order for the black chair
with a headrest. If we take a closer
look, we'll see the correct components
that are listed in the bill of
materials, including that headrest. And
if we click into the work orders tab
here, we can see that we have both
operations needed to produce this black
chair, including attaching that
headrest. As you can see, ODO
automatically selected the right bill of
materials and applied the correct
operations based entirely on the variant
that we chose in the sales order. Now,
let's complete this manufacturing
process on the shop floor. We're going
to head back to our homepage and click
into the shop floor module.
And here we'll see we have our new
manufacturing order here. And if we
click into assembly line one, we can
begin our first operation which is
attach the headrest. Since this variant
includes a headrest, this step is
automatically included once again. And
let's go ahead and start this now by
registering this one unit to produce.
And then we'll click mark as done for
this step.
Next up is the operation. Assemble chair
body and armrests. This step is required
for every variant whether or not it
includes a headrest. Once that's
complete, all we have to do is click
mark as done once again, followed by
close production.
And that's it. We've built a black
ergonomic chair with a headrest exactly
as ordered.
And that's a wrap. We built one
customizable chair variant from sales to
production using product variants,
builds of materials, and defined
operations to keep everything clear and
accurate. ODU handled the complexity
behind the scenes so every step stayed
efficient and error resistant. If you're
ready to build smarter and scale faster,
keep on exploring how ODU adapts to your
unique manufacturing needs. Until then,
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next video.
