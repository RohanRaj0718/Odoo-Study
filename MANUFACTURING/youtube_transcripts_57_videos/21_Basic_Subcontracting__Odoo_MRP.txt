================================================================================

welcome back oders my name is so ignasio
today we're going to talk about
subcontracting what is subcontracting
you ask well sometimes a company doesn't
have the resources necessary to
manufacture a product that they want to
sell in such a case they can hire a
subcontractor to manufacture the product
for them subcontracting has benefits for
both the subcontractor and the
Contracting Company among other things
it allows subcontractors to specialize
in the task that they're good at and it
helps Contracting companies adapt to
changing economic conditions as well
inside of this video we're going to be
discussing basics of Contracting in
which the subcontractor is responsible
for sourcing the components used for
manufacturing subcontracted products in
the following videos we're going to
cover some ways that you can supply the
subcontractor with components yourself
but today let's keep it simple all right
before we can use subcontracting inside
of Odo we first have to enable it so to
do so I'm actually going to open up the
manufacturing application over here and
now want to select configuration and
settings we're always here now over here
under the operations heading I need to
make sure that the check boox that is
next to you guessed it subcontracting
itself right there is selected and once
that I've already done that you want to
hit save in case you hav't so make sure
you check both and save it now with this
setting enabled a few new features
become available inside of ODU on
products bill of materials or bombs for
those acronym lovers we're going to be
able to select subcontracting as the
bomb type and specify by one or more
subcontractors who will manufacture the
product inside of the inventory app
which I'm going to go into right now
over here two subcontract specific
routes become available we have both the
resupply subcontractor routes as well as
the Dropship subcontractor route over
here on the right these can be assigned
to products on their product forms
themselves now these routes will be
covered in a future video but today
we're going to show you how to configure
a product and its bomb so that we can
subcontract its production so to do so
we actually want to go back to our main
dashboard over here and now we need to
open up once again the inventory app I
did that in case you haven't done this
yet and you were on a different screen
so right now we want to select products
and products great now first I need to
select in our case the product that I
like to talk about which is the
tricycle been doing a lot of stuff with
bikes lately I
feel okay once that we're inside of here
we want to make our way over to the
purchase tab now I've already added bike
friends which happens to be our vendor
right there this is the subcontractor
the manufactures our tricycle product
I've also specified the price that we
pay them for each tricycle 50 bucks
pretty affordable now next I want to
select the inventory tabs that we can
talk about you guessed it the routes in
here now I've enabled the buy route that
we have right there which tells ODU that
we will buy the product and then have it
shipped to us this means a receipt will
be created when we confirm a purchase
order for the the product the receipt is
then processed when we receive the
product now I could enable the replenish
on order which happens to be the MTO
route right below it as well which makes
it so that the purchase orders are
automatically created upon confirmation
of a sales order however this route
isn't strictly necessary for
subcontracted products so I'm just going
to show you the flow as it begins with a
purchase order in addition I could
select the drop ship route which you
were probably also wondering about down
there not the first one drop ship route
only instead of the Buy Route if I did
that the subcontractor would ship the
product directly to the customer instead
of sending it back to us in that case a
confirmed purchase order would create a
drop ship order instead of a receipt
order so remember that a confirmed
purchase order will create a drop ship
order not a receipt order all right now
that we configured the product I think
it's time for us to go check out that
bomb so in order for us to do that I'm
going to click on the bill of material
smart button up here at the top and then
we want to select the bomb for the
tricycle let's take a look at that so
the very first thing I need you to take
a look at is the bomb type as you
checked over here on the right you'll
notice it selected the subcontracting
option this tells ODU that this bomb's
corresponding product is manufactured by
a subcontractor which subcontractor you
ask well we can actually specify that in
the subcontractor's field right below it
you can specify multiple subcontractors
but for our tricycle product we only
have one bike friends now if you're also
an expert bomb maker like me you may
think it's time to add components down
below over here however we actually
don't need to add components when using
the basic subcontracting workflow that's
because the subcontractor is responsible
for every element of manufacturing
including the required components so
once a product is configured for basic
subcontracting the workflow for buying
it is similar to the workflow for
purchasing any product the main
difference is that we have to wait for
the subcontractor to manufacture the
product before they can actually ship it
we can even estimate the delivery date
using lead times which I'm going to be
covering in a video later in this series
all right let's go to our actual
workflow now so we're going to start out
by creating a purchase order to buy the
subcontracted product from the
subcontractor can't show you anything
till I create something like a PO so to
do so we're actually going to go out of
inventory back to our main database and
you guessed it I'm going to search for
and open up the purchase app now we want
to select orders up here at the top and
purchase orders actually great now we
need to select new top button over there
to the left now on the new purchase
order I'm going to add the subcontractor
which we said is bike friends not Bike
World I don't know why I did that I'm
sorry so that's for the vendor field
right there then I actually need to add
a product so select it down there in the
products and we're going to pick well
it's the tricycle that we're looking for
thank goodness for ODU Auto completing
and now that we're done all I actually
have to do is confirm this order right
over there and once I do that look at
that smart buttons appear right at the
top of the page now let's say that a few
days have passed and the subcontractor
has just delivered the tricycle to our
warehouse awesome that's the greatest
news ever so all that we need to do now
is open up the receipt order by clicking
on the receipt smart button over here or
you can also click on the receive
products button that was above the
purchase order I'm going to go back just
to talk about that see right there we
could do that but I use the but
button so once that we've opened the
receipt we just need to click validate
right there and the product is entered
into our inventory it's really that
simple and well it's time to go today
that's it for today friends you now know
how to configure products for the basic
subcontracting workflow stay tuned for
the rest of the videos in this series
where we're going to learn how to supply
subcontractors with components and use
lead times to estimate delivery dates
I'm going to see you soon o doers and if
I don't go grab a snack lays please
still sponsor me I'm running out of
chips bye
