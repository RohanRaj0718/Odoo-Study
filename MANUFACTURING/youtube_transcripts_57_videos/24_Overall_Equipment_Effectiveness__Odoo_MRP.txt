hello o doers as always it's so good to
see you again today I'm coming at you
with another great manufacturing app
tutorial this time we're going to be
talking about overall equipment
Effectiveness or OE for my acronym
lovers which is one of the manufacturing
apps reporting features the OE feature
tracks the amount of time a work center
is fully productive versus the amount of
time it is operating at reduced speed or
when it is blocked from being used now
before we jump into our database I want
to take a little time to define the
different work center statuses this is
going to make it easier to understand
the OE report when we look at it later
so first off we have fully productive
time when a work center is fully
productive it means it's processing a
work order that has not exceeded its
expected duration for example if a work
order has an expected duration of let's
say 60 minutes and it is completed in 57
minutes all of that time is considered
to be fully productive now up next we
have reduced speed which is when a work
center is processing a work order that
has exceeded its expected duration using
our previous example of a work order
with an expected duration of 60 minutes
let's say it takes 70 minutes to
complete the extra 10 minutes is counted
as reduced speed time reduce speed
negatively impacts a work Center's OE
score even though the work center is
operational and then finally we have a
few different statuses all of which
result in the work center being blocked
or prevented from receiving work orders
these include equipment availability
equipment failure Steve and process
defects as well as a few others okay
Steve wasn't the real one but you get my
points all right now that we've learned
about all of those statuses let's see
how we can configure work center to
properly track OE with Odo so here we
are on the main dashboard I'm going to
start by opening up the manufacturing
application over here going up to config
configuration and then work centers
let's select our assembly Station 2 over
here and here we have its form so there
are three fields we need to focus on
over here inside of the production
information header the ones that we want
to focus on is time efficiency capacity
and OE Target so I think it's time for
me to break down time efficiency real
quick now time efficiency refers to how
efficient the work center is processing
work orders an efficiency value of 100%
means that the work center processes
orders at the rate of their expected
duration alternatively an efficiency
value of let's say 50% or 200% would
signify that the work center processes
work orders at half the speed or twice
the speed respectively that makes sense
right so let's jump back over to our
database and I'm going to discuss those
other fields further so here we have
capacity right there you'll notice it
just says one which means that the work
center can only handle one unit at a
time so if an ammo is created for two
units of a product with a work order
that takes 10 minutes it would take 20
minutes to process it at this work
center because you'd have to manufacture
each unit one at a time so finally we
have the OE Target right there I've set
it to 90% this is our goal for how much
of the work Center's operating time
should be fully productive time so we
want this work center to be fully
productive at least 90% of the time H I
know that is a lot of info to taken at
once o doers it's important to have
these values set correctly doing so
ensures that ODU properly tracks fully
prod Ive time versus reduced speed time
all right let's actually move on to the
oee report itself there are a couple of
ways that we can actually view it first
I can actually navigate over to my
overview page that we have over here and
then we will see our actual work centers
and on the card free to the work centers
they have an oee button that we can see
here some are in red some are in green
so this number that we have right there
represents the percentage of fully
productive time for the work center the
number that appears in green for in our
case this drill station one over here
means the work center is at or above its
OE Target on assembly station one as I
just talked about the red color over
here we have it well it's in red which
means that the work center is not
meeting its OE targets if I click on the
OE button on one of these cards like in
our case let's select the green one
because it's better to show it there I'm
taking to the oee report for that
specific work center if I want to view
OE data for every work center actually
need to click on uh actually over here
in reporting almost went to the wrong
area sorry about that overall equipment
Effectiveness and there we have it like
most reporting dashboards I can view the
data as in our case bar chart line chart
py graph everything you want we can even
go further than that and go all the way
over here and do pivot tables list
honestly you can name it through all of
these so for now let's actually go back
over to our graphs and we're going to
stick with our bar chart over here
so each view shows me the total amount
of time tracked for each work center as
well as how that time is broken down
into various work center statuses so
once again at drill station one for
example we can see that most of the
track time has been fully productive
time which happens to be that dark blue
section over there now this is a smaller
polar Shin over here that we have
reduced speed time in the nice little
orange right there so now in our case
let's talk about how each staus type is
tracked for a work center so this can be
accomplished to the manufacturing app or
the shop Thor module so in our case I've
created ano for our coat wrap product
use as an example so I'm going to open
that now we're going to go to operations
and Manufacturing orders and just as I
talked about it right now we have this
one right there our nice little coat
rack so on the ammo I'm going to select
the work orders tab over here and here's
where the oee report comes into play if
in our case case the real duration that
we have right there is less than the
expected duration over there the time is
counted as fully productive if in our
case the expected duration that we have
over there is actually going to be more
then we have a situation where that
excess time is counted as a reduced
speed if the real duration exceeds that
60 of expected okay but what about when
a work center is blocked how do we track
that as the more Eagle IO doers may have
already guessed we do so by clicking on
the Block button that we have right
there on a work order so we're actually
going to do that right now for this
drill poll and right now we have the
block work center popup that appears I
need to choose a loss reason so I think
it's going to be the reason why this was
lost there are a few options to choose
from including material availability
equipment failure setup process defect
reduce yield and the list goes on or if
I wanted to I can actually just start
typing and click create once that I get
typing away so our selected reason is
then recorded on the oee report for this
work center for this one I'm going to
select equipment failure and then I'm
just going to click block I don't want
to say what happened so once the work
center is ready to be used once again
all I need to do is Click unblock on the
line of the work order and just doing
that immediately we're ready to go once
again okay so before I finish this
tutorial I just want to quickly mention
that work centers can also be blocked
and unblocked from the shop floor module
so back over here on our main dashboard
we're going to open up shop floor and
take a look at any work order over here
and you want to click on these three
dots in the bottom right and this is our
additional options menu on a work order
and to unlock or in this case unblock it
or block it you just click on this
button at the bottom and that's how you
do it and that's it for now folks thanks
for sticking around until the end you're
now ready to use the oee report to gain
deeper insights into the productivity of
your work centers I'm going to see you
soon o doers go grab a snack
