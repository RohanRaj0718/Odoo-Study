hello doers my name is Jose Ignacio and
I'm here to greet you my hard-working
manufacturers now let's talk more about
work centers I can't shut up about them
now the planned production time for a
work order is based on the duration that
we assigned to that particular operation
however
when we take other factors like
efficiency and capacity into account
calculating how long a work center
remains in use becomes a tad more
complicated we don't like math here now
luckily Oda does the math and the
planning for us now when we configure
values for efficiency and capacity along
with setup and cleanup times odoo
factors these numbers into the work
center schedule now being able to assign
custom values to each work center ahead
of time gives us a more realistic
picture of what our short-term
manufacturing plan should look like now
I'm getting excited again hero doers so
let's hop into our database and see how
customizing workcenter parameters can
affect your planning
all right before we get to our work
centers let's examine the product that
we're going to be using which is the
rusty crate not a brand new crate rustic
so let's go over to our manufacturing
app products going back in here and
there we are Rusty crate all right now
let's take a look at our bill of
materials or bomb for my acronym lovers
so let's look over here into our
operations tab as well now we see that
this product requires one operation in
the assembly line one work center wow
that is a mouthful and it's expected to
take 60 minutes or an hour using basic
conversion now we know about this
product's basic setup and everything
just using these quick little checks but
let's take a closer look at assembly
line one work sender so let's see how it
gets manufactured so we're gonna go to
configuration work centers assembly line
one all right now here we can custom the
work Center's production specifications
like time efficiency capacity as well as
the setup and the cleanup times as well
but let's go over each of these features
one by one I don't want you to miss
anything so put your thinking ears on
right now all right so first let's see
how time efficiency affects our
production planning now right now this
value is set to what oh doers it is
actually set to a hundred percent
which means we expect the work orders to
take just as long as the operation says
it will a hundred percent efficiency
means that now for example since we set
the rustic rustic crate I'm always
thinking about chairs small little
doopsy The Rustic crates assembly
operation to 60 minutes and the work
center has a Time efficiency of 100 what
does that mean that means it should take
exactly 60 Minutes as well now
however what happens if we change that
though now that I'm thinking about that
if I set it to 200 percent then clearly
it should take 30 minutes by basic math
simple enough right now moving on beyond
that the capacity field well what does
this represent now this represents how
many products can be produced
simultaneously for this particular work
center now if we think about that how
does capacity affect the work center
timing well if my work Center capacity
is one
and I plan a manufacturing order of two
of the crates Oda will reserve the work
center for 120 Minutes essentially it
knows that I need double that time and
that is basically because the work
center can only create one crate at a
time and each one of them takes 60
minutes sorry if I'm going over this
basic math a little bit but it's good to
know however if I increase the work
Center capacity to two the same
manufacturing order for the two crates
should technically take only one hour
since we would be able to produce both
crates at the same time at the work
center and in programming we call that
parallel programming or parallel
processing
now
yeah
uh we're just doing this today now over
here we have oee or the overall
equipment Effectiveness and this is an
important concept that I'll cover in
another video and I would love it if you
watch that video so that you know that
concept because it is actually a little
bit of a bigger topic that I can't just
cover really quickly so be sure to check
that out so for now we're going to leave
this at a mysterious zero that you don't
know why yet
now if you process a lot of different
products at the same work center the
work center might accommodate different
capacities for different products for
example your work center might be able
to handle five wood panels at a time
since they're easy to produce now to
configure these specific capacities all
we have to do is go to the specific
capacities Tab and then you click align
and then well what did we just say we
need a wood panel
and five
now odoo knows the disassembly line is
able to produce and handle five wood
panels at a time and isn't that Dandy
now if I wanted to I can also configure
specific setup and cleanup times for
product by accessing again the
additional options over here and as you
can see to the right of the capacity
column
there we have everything but we don't
need any cleanup and setup at this
particular
you know type of assembly of wood panels
they don't need that so we don't have to
fill them in all right now going back to
the general information tab what do we
have outdoers well we also have setup
and cleanup times again under operations
now these are useful to configure
especially if you have rigorous safety
protocols in place now when you assign
setup and cleanup times to a workcenter
ode will automatically add these times
to any work orders that need to be
completed at the work center now lastly
under the operations tab again we have
one more thing and in here I can also
require employees to log into work
centers this is especially useful if you
need to ensure that the right people are
getting into the right buildings and you
can even restrict work center access to
a certain employees
but we won't need any of these digital
buildings blocks right now
so in our case we don't need any
sign-ins at this work center so we're
actually going to uncheck this
all right we're done
finally now you know what it means to do
all of this and you know what time it is
outdoors it's time for us to test this
so let me show you how we set this all
up
all right so first I'll create a ammo or
manufacturing order using the default
settings for this work center so we're
going to go with 100 efficiency capacity
of one no setup or cleanup times now to
reset my work center to its default
settings all I have to do is just
discard my changes by clicking on this
icon that I like to call the forget
about it button over here now
once that you do that you notice
something else happens only the settings
revert the products in our specific
capacities tab always remain and that's
kind of useful as a little Pro tip so
that you don't get scared about or
forget about it button all right now as
well as this it's time to make our
manufacturing order so we're going to
manufacture two rusted crates now let's
plan this ammo for tomorrow at 8am so we
can easily identify it in the work
center schedule and then once we get
that going
all of this looks good right now and I
love how easy it is for everything to
always work in Odo it makes my job very
easy oh doers and then we confirm this
now after we confirm the ammo there's a
few other things that I'd like to talk
about now the very first thing is we'll
see that the plan button appears finally
up here now it's a very important button
because when we click this button
ODU will reserve a work center for us
just for us to manufacture our little
thing here now if you see the scheduled
date appears finally in the work orders
tab now for more in-depth explanation
about how planning Works in odoo check
out some of our other tutorials please
now
let's view our plan work orders for the
work center which we can actually do so
by clicking on the planning menu and
selecting Planning by work center now to
get a closer look we'll view the weekly
schedule in our case and as you can see
this work order is planned from eight to
ten since we're making two rustic crates
and we're expecting to spend an hour
manufacturing each one
that's pretty much a lot of time right
there and this is basically our base
operation time now let's see what
happens
when I actually change the time here
after I change our work center
specifications so we're going to go into
configuration work centers assembly line
one now this time we'll change the
capacity to two
setup time to 10.
and cleanup time of also 10. it looks
like I'm raising the roof today now
let's create a new ammo just to test
this Auto doers I feel like whenever I
change things I have to show you so
we're going to go to manufacturing
orders and we're going to create a new
one now just like last time we'll
manufacture two rustic crates and let's
plan this for the day after tomorrow so
that we can actually see how clearly it
is inside of the schedule now
once that we confirm this we're gonna
finally hit our big old plan button just
like before now let's take a look at the
work Center calendar again and you're
going to see something really cool now
as we could see here this work order is
planned between 8 and 9 20 a.m since we
upped our work Center capacity to two we
can do both of them at the same time now
and I find that to be so cool that
everything worked out now therefore even
though we created an identical ammo for
two rustic crates we only need to spend
an hour manufacturing both of the crates
after adjusting the work Center capacity
now if you notice over here too ODU also
takes our 10 minute setup and 10 minute
cleanup times into account which is why
we have that odd 920 because nine plus
ten setup plus 10 cleanup you get your
920. now I also want you to keep in mind
in this example I didn't change the time
efficiency if I had changed the time
efficiency or te we would have further
impacted the scheduled time and I'm
going to sit up for this because we had
a lot of setup
there you have it Outdoors if I had been
sitting on a rustic crate I'd be feeling
way more revitalized right now but
all I could tell you is that customizing
workcenter specifications with Odo gives
you a more realistic idea of when your
work centers are going to be used and
and this is especially important how
much they can produce in a given time
frame allowing you to plan your
manufacturing with greater case and
efficiency
