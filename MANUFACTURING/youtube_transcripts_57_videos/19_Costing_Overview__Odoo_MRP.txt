foreign
hello doers and welcome back my name is
Jose Ignacio now let's talk costing now
in manufacturing costing involves
totaling the cost associated with
production including the cost of direct
materials operations and any additional
overhead you might have now in the next
couple videos we'll cover how each of
these work and what Odo has to offer
when it comes to them and how to
configure them now inside of Odo there
are three primary costing methods
standard price
average cost or avco and first in first
out which is fun to say at fifo now
following the standard price method the
product cost is defined strictly by what
the product form says now with the
average cost method odoo averages the
values of the products in stock which is
particularly useful if components are
sourced from multiple vendors or they're
bought at different prices now the fifo
costing method uses the cost of the
earliest manufactured product in stock
as the product cost and then once that
product is removed from the stock the
next earliest manufactured product will
determine the product cost now enough
Chit Chat let's hop into our database
and see these in action
all right deer so here we are on the
manufacturing dashboard now first let's
check out my billing materials or bombs
now today I'll be manufacturing a table
so let's go up here to our products fill
the materials table and we're there now
to build my table I'll be using four
table legs and one table top now if we
select the table legs internal link with
this little arrow right there you'll
notice something we can see that the
table leg has an Associated cost of five
dollars on the product template now if
we select the actual tabletop you'll
notice something similarly it has a ten
dollar cost over here
perfect now we know what we're working
with in terms of cost all right now back
on over here when we go through the
operations tab we can actually see that
it's going to be at the work center
assembly line one not to view the actual
details we're going to select the actual
work center by selecting assembly line
one and you'll get a bit of information
here including the worksheet and some
other info now if we want to actually
directly see information about assembly
line one we just click on this little
internal link and there we have it now
you'll notice that the cost per hour for
assembly line one is defined right over
here
and that's pretty useful in our case
since the table assembly is scheduled on
the bomb to take one hour to complete
the operation will cost us 50 dollars
because basic math easy enough let's get
out of here enough math
all right next I want to show you the
overview report so we're going to select
the overview smart button and there we
are now you may notice that there are
two cost columns over here to the right
we have a bomb cost product cost now
let's go over bomb cost so bomb cost is
simply the sum of the component and
operational costs according to the last
manufacturing order that was processed
and then to the right product cost is
the cost stated on the product form and
depending on the costing method it may
give a different value from the bomb
cost now there are certain cases in
which I may want to use the bomb cost as
the product cost for example if we don't
produce tables very often and we
experience a lot of fluctuation around
component costs the bomb cost will
update unlike the product cost therefore
using the bomb cost as our Benchmark is
a good way to stay current now to do so
we're actually going to go back to the
product template for the final product
in our case we can actually just select
the word table over here boom we're back
over there now up next over here next
the cost I can click on this compute
price from bomb button over here and
when we select it magic happens oh look
at that eighty dollars it went from zero
to 80. now you can see that the cost
just changed to eighty dollars since
that's what the materials and labor
costs in the bomber reflect now when I
look at the structure and cost report
again when we go back over here to our
bomb overview
boom look at that product cost now
matches the bomb cost the stars have
aligned though doers now let's examine
how to configure the costing methods in
odoo which will determine the product
cost of each of our components now to
change our costing method we need to go
to the inventory app we're going to
reach that
there we are and then we're going to go
into configuration and product
categories and in our case
components
you want to select your relevant product
category now here you can view all the
products in this category by selecting
up here where we have this listed and
you'll notice in our case we have table
legs and table tops but we're going to
go back over here now as you'll notice
over here looking at the product
category I've established the costing
method as standard price now you can
change the costing method by selecting
from a drop down you can change it to
fifo although it'll give you a warning
and a few other things because
thankfully it'll give you a lot of
warnings we're going to discard that
real quick all right now you'll notice
that if we go back over here to product
categories each product category can
have its own costing method associated
with it as you saw I change components
and you can change a lot of other ones
over here now for example let's assume
that a simple manufacturing process the
components and the final products will
share the same costing method so in our
case let's select finish goods and
you'll notice also standard price right
there now it should be noted that if you
want to change the costing method of an
individual product you'll either have to
change the category it belongs to or
you'll have to change the costing method
on the existing product category now to
change the product category on the
product template I'll jump on over to it
and select it so that I could show you
that so let's go up here to products
we're going to select products again
um let's select tablex and if you look
over here there it is right there odors
it also has a little internal link that
you could jump to but here's where you
change the product category now
there you have it odors now we know how
to find the structure and cost report
from a bill of materials and how to
change the costing method through
product categories in the inventory app
for more in-depth information on how
each of these work be sure to check out
the following costing tutorials when
they pop up now
I say this because you'll know it'll
cost you a little bit of your time so
that's it for now I'll see you next time
oh doers go grab a snack
