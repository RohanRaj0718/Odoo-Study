================================================================================

welcome back my friends to the tutorial
That Never Ends I'm so glad you could
attend step inside step inside today
we're going to be discussing how to use
unbuild orders in the manufacturing app
you co doers running and Manufacturing
operation isn't always about building
stuff sometimes you have to unbuild
something that you've previously built
this can be necessary for a variety of
reasons for example you maybe you built
too many units of an item or perhaps you
want to unbuild a product so you can use
its components to manufacture a
different product whatever your reason
and I'm sure you've got a good one Odo
makes it exceptionally easy to unbuild
products all while ensuring that
inventory counts for finished products
and components remain accurate so enough
chitchat let's jump into our Odo
database now to see how this all works
so before we create an unbuild order I
want to quickly show you a couple of
things first let's take a look at the
actual onhand count for the product that
we're going to be unbuilding our coat
rack as well as the components that are
used to build it so to do so I'm
actually going to jump into the
manufacturing application over here I'm
going to select products up at the top
and products once again now as you can
see from each product card I have one
unit of the coat rack in stock over here
as for the coat rack's components they
actually happen to be the wooden dowels
and the wooden pole and I have whatever
units that I have on hand but you need
to remember these numbers which happens
to be 750 and 91 so write them down
somewhere and spoiler alert something is
going to change now next we're going to
take a look at the build of materials or
bomb for our coat rack so I'm going to
get there by clicking on the coat rack
product card right there and immediately
I could just use the smart button up at
the top and there we are right there now
let's take a look at in our case we
actually want the very first one right
there on the list so we're going to
select that one and let's take a look at
the components tab right here here we
can see that one coat rack is is made up
of a wooden pole and then six of these
actual dowels down there this means that
when we unbuild a CRA we should be left
with that number of each component to
see this in action let's get to what
this video is really about the unbuild
order itself so to create a new unbuild
orderer all I actually need to do is
select the operation sub heading up at
the top and then I want to select you
guess it unbuild orders now we're going
to select new in the top left on this
new order I'm going to start by
selecting our coat rack product over
there and then everything is set when I
do that you'll notice that the main
build of materials or bomb for the
product is automatically selected in the
Bill of material field that we have
right below it if I want to choose a
different bomb I can actually do so by
clicking on the drop down menu right
there inside of here and selecting
something else in our case I'm not going
to do that I don't want to mess things
up alternatively I could also select a
specific bomb in the build of materials
field before selecting a product in
which case the product field would autop
populate with the corresponding product
which is kind of nice now inside of the
quantity field I can actually specify
the quantity of the product that we need
to unbuild for this example I'm going to
leave it at just one unit now if the
product being unbuilt was originally
created in a specific manufacturing
order I can actually select it in the
manufacturing order field over here and
let's see actually gives us a full list
right there we can actually select any
of them we'll just pick one now the
source location field that we have which
happens to be right below it is used to
specify the location where the product
being unbuilt is stored the destination
location field is used to specify the
location where the reclaimed components
will be stored after unbuilding is
completed both of these fields are set
by default to our main warehouse
location I'm just going to leave them as
is for this order all right now that
this form is all filled out let's
actually go ahead and pretend that we've
disassembled our coat wack into its
components and they're all behind me now
with that done all we have to do to
complete the unbuild order is click on
the unbuild button in the top left boom
once that we do that we'll no that the
stage indicator in the top right corner
of the form moves from draft to done and
just like that we've unbuilt one unit of
our coat rack product and registered it
inside of ododo now you would expect the
inventory counts for a coat rack and its
components to have updated automatically
but let's just do a quick check to make
sure that that's actually what's
happened so to do so products up at the
top and
products now from the product cards I
can actually see that the number of coat
racks on hand happens to now be Zero
from one and while the onand counts for
the wooden D and wooden P wooden poem
wooden pole components sorry smaller
dupsy have actually increased by six
which happens to be the dowels and one
for the actual pole perfect that's just
what we expected to happen now you may
be thinking to yourself what happens
when I try to create an unbuilt order
for a product that I don't have on hand
well like all things that we try inside
of Jose's Odo Labs let's take a quick
look as an example we're going to use
the C Rak product which now is actually
at zero so for that I need to First is
Select operations once again un build
orders and you guessed it once again new
select that coat rack once again inside
of our products let everything pop you
click out of that and you'll notice once
that everything is done we're going to
select unb build and oh my goodness
would you look at that I have a warning
and this warning is that I have an
insufficient quantity of corax to
unbuild now ODU will allow me to proceed
with the unbuild order which I can do by
clicking on confirm right there on the
right however as the popup States this
may lead to inconsistencies in my
inventory I don't want that to happen so
I'm just going to click discard right
there all right before I let you go
there's just one more thing sometimes
during the unbuilding process a
component becomes unusable for one
reason or another when this happens it
is necessary to remove the component
from in inventory using a scrap order if
you want to learn how to do so check out
the video in the description below or
I'm going to include a link to our video
on scrap orders and that's all I've got
for you folks today I showed you how to
disassemble finished products into their
components using unbuild orders stay
tuned for more exciting tutorials
because I know you will I love you have
a great night
