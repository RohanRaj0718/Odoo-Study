What's going on, Odoers? Welcome back.
Nathan here, and in today's video, we're
going to walk through the basics of work
centers in ODO manufacturing. If you're
new to ODO or just getting started with
the manufacturing module, work centers
are one of the foundational pieces
you'll want to understand. They help
define where production happens, what
resources are used, and how long
operations take. Think of a work center
in Odo as a location where manufacturing
operations are performed. Here at
Stealthy Wood, we have our cutting
station, sanding station, varnishing
booth, and assembly station. These work
centers allow us to track capacity,
efficiency, working hours, and OEE
metrics. In short, work centers help you
organize your production flow and give
structure to your manufacturing process.
So, let's jump into our database and see
how this all works. Today we're starting
off in the manufacturing app. The first
screen we land on is our work centers
overview page which provides a
comprehensive snapshot of all the work
centers in our stealthy wood database.
Each card shows how many work orders are
ready to be launched as well as the
current OEE for that work center. OEE
stands for overall equipment
effectiveness. The higher the
percentage, the better the work center
is performing. And if we click on this
work orders button,
we can see every operation that's ready
to be started. In the event you see a
plan orders button, that simply means
there are no work orders currently
scheduled for that particular work
center. Next to those buttons, you'll
also notice a small monitor icon. And
clicking that button takes you straight
into the shop floor module. We won't be
covering shop floor today as we have a
separate video that goes into depth, but
I'll make sure to link that down below.
Today, we're going to create a brand new
work center because Stealthy Wood is
introducing a new product that requires
a table saw during production. To create
a new work center, we're going to head
to configuration at the top and click
on, you guessed it, work centers. Then
on this work centers page, we're just
going to click new in the top left
corner. And that brings us to a brand
new setup page where we can configure
all the necessary settings. First, we're
going to give our new work center a
name. I'm just going to type in saw
station.
And to help identify it easily, I'll
also assign a unique code, which will be
saw one, as well as a classifying tag.
The working hours field defaults to the
standard 40hour work week. If you ever
need to shorten or expand that schedule,
you can select a different schedule from
the drop down.
Since this is our only table saw, we're
going to leave this alternative work
center station blank. And then we're
going to move down to the general
information tab. The first section is
titled production information. The time
efficiency here tells ODO whether the
station is typically working faster or
slower than expected. In addition, the
OEE target field is the minimum
performance level we want this work
center to maintain. Both of these
suggested values look good, so we're
going to keep them as is. Next, it takes
10 minutes to set up and another 10
minutes to clean up the station. So, in
the setup field, I'm going to enter 10.
In the cleanup time field, I will enter
another 10. The table saw used at this
station is extremely dangerous. Only one
employee, Joseio, is trained to operate
it. So, we're going to add him in the
allowed employees field.
If this field is left empty, it means
anyone can use this work center, which
of course is not what we want in this
case. Below that, we can add a brief
description of what this work center
does. Since the name SA station is
already pretty clear, we're going to
leave this blank.
Going back up on the right, we can add
some costing and accounting information.
We're not going to set those up today.
So, I'll skip over to the product
capacities tab.
Inside the product capacities tab, we
can control the number of products that
can be processed simultaneously. I'm
going to set the capacity to five by
clicking add a line and then entering
five in the capacity field
just to keep things from getting too
crowded around the saw. By default,
you'll see all products is listed in the
product column. However, if you ever
need to set a specific capacity for a
specific product, we can click add a
line and select that product here.
And that's it. Our new saw station is
officially set up. If we head back to
the work center overview page, we can
see it's listed and now ready for use.
From here, we can add it to a bill of
materials and begin using it to carry
out work orders. And that's a wrap.
Today, we explored how work centers help
organize and manage production inside of
Odo. The work center overview gives
clear visibility into performance OEE
and any work orders that are ready to be
launched. Creating a new work center
enables you to define how that station
operates from its working hours and
efficiency settings to safety
restrictions, setup times, cleanup
times, and even the maximum number of
products that can be handled
simultaneously.
Altogether, these tools make it easy to
maintain an efficient, consistent, and
well ststructured production
environment, ensuring everything on the
shop floor runs smoothly. Thanks for
watching, Odoers, and I'll see you in
the next video.
