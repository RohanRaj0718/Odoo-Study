================================================================================

hello doers my name is hosio and welcome
back for another great tutorial So today
we're actually talking about subassembly
which is when we manufacture a component
before using it to manufacture another
product you see not every product we
manufactur has made with pre-made
components that are bought ready to use
sometimes we have to get into the
nitty-gritty and manufacturer products
components ourselves so for example
let's take a look at our wheelie table
product product unsurprisingly it's a
table with wheels so to manufacture this
table we need to attach our four wheelie
legs to a tabletop however before the
legs can be attached we have to assemble
them as well by adding our wheel
component to the bottom of our leg
component that means that from start to
finish manufacturing our table requires
not one but two manufacturing orders
oros now I could just manufacture a
bunch of the wheelie legs ahead of time
you know they're ready whenever we want
to build a table however I i' rather
manufacture four legs each time I need
them for a table and luckily Odo allows
me to do just that by automatically
creating anmo for our four wheelie legs
each time an emmo for the table is
confirmed so let's manufacture one unit
of our wheelie table now just so I can
show you how all of this
works okay so before we create an emmo
we need to make sure that our wheelie
table product and all of its components
are correctly configured so in order for
us to do that we actually want to open
up our manufacturing application and
we're going to select the word products
and products object
obviously so once that we're here we
want to select our wheelie table so
let's find that at the bottom over here
now from the inventory tab that I've now
opened up over here you can actually see
that I've enabled the manufacturer route
now let's actually take a look at the
table's bombs by clicking on our bill
material smart button up at the top as
well and we're going to select it in
there great so we're there so if I click
inside of the operations tab you can
actually see that this product requires
one operation at our assembly station
and that happens to be attaching the leg
to the tabletop so on the components tab
over here well that requires two
different components four of the wheelie
legs as you can tell by the quantity and
then one of the tabletops so we
purchased the tabletop from a vendor and
already have a bunch in stock so we
don't have to worry about manufacturing
that we will need to manufacture the
wheelie leg however so let's open up X
product so that we could take a look at
that as well and if we want to jump to
it we can actually just click on this
little internal link Arrow right there I
love that about ODU now inside of here
let's go to inventory now inside here
you can see that I've selected the
replenishment order MTO route as well as
the manufacturer routes the MTO route
creates a replenishment order every time
there's a need for the component since
the manufacturer route is selected as
well it creates an ml now I want to take
a look at this bomb as well for the
wheelie leg so let's go in there as well
go into our build materials wheelie leg
great so here we can actually see that
each wheelie leg requires one table leg
and then one wheel as well much like the
tabletop we purchased both of these
components but if we wanted to
manufacture them I could open the
product pages and configure them the
same way that I've configured the
wheelie leg so if I did that eacho for
the wheelie leg would also create ano
for each component so if we go over here
to our operations tab as you can tell we
also have one operation listed for the
assembly workstation all right since we
have both of the wheelie components in
stock we're actually all ready to
manufacture the our table so let's go do
that so I am actually going to start by
creating an emmo for one unit of the
wheelie table so to do that we click on
the word operation and then
manufacturing orders and then we want to
select the word new you've done this
dance with me a lot so let's select our
wheelie table as our product that we're
going to be manufacturing and then
confirm this real quick great so once
that I do that a few things happen first
the forecast section over here on our
components tab as you can tell it tells
us something it displays today's date
for the wheelie leg component as well
this is because we don't have the legs
available yet but OD recognizes that we
should be finishing manufacturing for
them today have do we go about
manufacturing them well you may have
also noticed the child Mo smart button
happens to appear right there H what
does that do so since we enabled the MTO
route on our wheelie leg component an
ammo was created automatically to
fulfill our need for it as such Odo
considers that emmo the child of this
source emmo so we can actually access it
by clicking on the childo button let's
click into that so the child emmo is
linked back to its parents by this
Source emmo smart button that we have
now here and down on the component tab
wouldn't you notice that we can see that
both the components we need are
available as we can tell from our
forecast all right we're now ready to
begin manufacturing our wheelie table
but first let me show you how planning
works for OS that use sub assemblies we
actually want to make sure that the Emos
are planned in the correct order so that
we won't start working on our wheelie
table ammo before we've actually
manufactured the wheelie legs so to do
so we're actually going to head back to
the manufacturing orders we have the
breadcrumbs which are Wonder Bread today
we're going to select them both and
select plan and then once we do that
we're going to actually select the
planning dropdown from the top and then
we're going to select Planning by
production and on this page I'm going to
click on the time period drop down that
we have over here and I'm going to
select the day option and would you look
at that that's going to give me more
detail about how ouros have been planned
so we're actually going to select the
first one that's set to open which
happens to be our attach wheel component
right there this is because ODU
recognizes that the child emmo must be
completed before the parent emmo do you
notice that the time listed in the stop
date field on the popover window for the
child activity it actually gives us
something there well if I click away and
then I click on the parent emmo you'll
notice something the start date happens
to be the exact same time this is
because ODU knows that once the child
demo is completed all components will be
available for the parent emmo so it
schedules it to begin immediately after
now all we have to do is complete the
child emo and then we'll be ready to
start work on the parent emmo at that
point we'll have Manu ufactured one unit
of our wheelie table that's pretty cool
right so for today's example we use a
manufactured product that requires
another manufactured product as its
components however the really cool thing
about subassembly products in ODU is
that they can have as many levels as you
want for example you can manufacture a
bike spoke which is then used to make a
bike rim which is then used to make a
bike wheel which is finally used to
produce a full bike and as you can see
ODU simplifies the production of even
the most complicated multi-step
Manufacturing workflows that's the best
part of it well that's it for today
folks you now know how to manufacture
products using sub assemblies I'm going
to see you next time go grab a snack
