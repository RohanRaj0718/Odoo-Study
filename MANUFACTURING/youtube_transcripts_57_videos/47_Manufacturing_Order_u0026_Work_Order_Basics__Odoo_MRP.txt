what's up oders and welcome back today
we're discussing manufacturing orders
oros as well as the work orders within
them not's manufacturing app a mo or
manufacturing order specifies which
product needs to be produced including
the quantity required materials and
production timeline it serves as a key
document in the manufacturing process
ensuring that the right products are
made according to the demand and
operational capacity for example let's
say that we received order for I don't
know five office desks to ensure that we
manufacture the right quantity while
tracking the raw materials used and
assembly steps we create anmo for five
units within thato work orders break the
process into structured steps helping
manufacturers managed task to fulfill
ano like maybe cutting wood assembling
parts and applying finishing touches
that makes sense right enough chitchat
let's jump into ODU so I can show you
exactly what I mean all right let's
start off on the Odo Manufacturing app
dashboard to create a new ammo all I
need to do is Select operations and then
manufacturing orders follow this by
selecting new at the top left over here
and here we have a newo form for us to
fill out so here the first thing we need
to do is sel the product that we want to
manufacture inside of our product field
since we already mentioned it think we
should go with the office
desk okay it's important to remember
that Emos can only be created for one or
more units of a single product if I want
to manufacture a coat rack as well I
need to create a separate Mo for it now
after I select the product a few things
change on the mo form first the build of
material field autop populates right
there with the build of materials are
bomb for the product essentially if you
don't know a bomb is the blueprint for
how the product should be made including
the full list of all of the required
ingredients components work orders you
name it if you already know a bit about
bombs you'll also know that a single
product can have multiple bombs I want
to select a different one inside of voto
for thiso I can do so by clicking in the
bill material field now you notice
there's an option for a standing office
desk bomb I'm not going to do that
though right now believe it or not
standing desks are great Until you
realize you've been standing still like
you're waiting in line at the DMV we
don't want that right now it's also
worth mentioning that you can select a
specific bomb before a product is
selected which causes the product feeli
to autop populate instead in the reverse
however by selecting the product first
it makes the build material field only
show bombs for that specific product So
Below the product field is the quantity
field that we also happen to have right
there here we can enter the amount of
desks that will be manufactured for
example I can enter a quantity of five
we're going to click away doing so would
automatically update the component
quantities that we have over here for
the work orders and you'll kind of
notice if we go over to work orders
expected duration has gone up as well
right here that's pretty interesting but
being said we're going to go back to one
the two other sections of the form that
autop populate when I Pro product or
bomb is selected are the components and
the work orders so the components tab
shows us as I said all the components
needed to manufacture the specific
product in the case of the office test
it needs a desktop a single one and then
four wooden legs right there on the
right side of the product lines we also
see the required quantity for each
component as I just talked about if I
click into our work orders tab over here
I could see the operations required to
manufacture the product in this case we
need to cut the desktop and I'm going to
stretch so you can see so we need to cut
the desktop over there and then we add
the wooden legs afterwards the line for
each operation also shows the work
center where it will be carried out
assembly one and assembly two and the
expected duration that we happen to have
right over here and then you can also
have a real duration as well as you can
see both of these operations will take
exactly 60 Minutes to complete now
you've probably already figured out that
the combined time to complete both
operations as a total of 2 hours so
where can we see that reflected on the
MMO
form okay so if we click confirm up in
the top left of the MMO we will see in
our case a scheduled end over here and
if we take a look at the scheduled date
and end fields we will see that these
fields are automatically updated based
on the two operations estimated times
right there the estimated time end for
the scheduled end happens to be exactly
2 hours after the schedule date makes
sense right if I want to I can also
change the schedule datee up at the top
by selecting into it and this indicates
when I need to start building the desk
however the end field can't be modified
and will always be set to the scheduled
date plus the expected duration of all
the work orders as servant OD doers
might notice
this we actually happen to new have a
new component status field that has
appeared right there since we have all
the required components in stock the
status is available and it's green if we
were missing one or more required
components it would instead read not
available furthermore the word available
appears in a green font as I just
mentioned this means that the ammo is
good to go ready to start we can also
see this reflected in the chatter as
well as you could tell over
here so everything happens to be ready
what else can that mean well that means
that we can go right now we have one
step manufacturing enabled this means
that Emos will be marked as ready as
long as we have enough components in
stock if we were using two or resep
manufacturing we would need to transfer
components to the production location
before the emmo would be ready to start
in that situation component status would
still be available but it would appear
in an orange color or perhaps yellow if
you are a little bit colorblind which
means waiting for components so down
over here in our work orders tab we see
a real duration column that I was
talking about earlier which was there
before the ammo was confirmed but it now
reads a zero for each work order the
real duration represents the actual time
that it takes to complete a work order
we also see in our case a new status
column over there which displays the
current status for each work order the
cut desktop one is ready right now since
it's the first work order and the emo
itself is ready if I happen to click on
the green start button right there on
the right the real duration timer Begins
Counting as you can tell right there and
the status changes itself to in progress
the insert wooden legs work order is
marked as waiting right now because you
guessed it the cut desktop work order
needs to be completed first if I click
on the green done check bar right over
there would you look at that the status
of insert wedding insert the wooden leg
small little dupsy right there happens
to be ready since it's no longer waiting
on the other work orders I'm just going
to also very quickly complete that one
right there and now we're done
fully okay so everything is done with
both War quarters completed and marked
as finished I'm ready to close out the
ammo so to do that all I need to do is
click on our produce all button at the
top of the screen right there and just
like that Theo is closed and we've
officially produced One office test not
too shabby right and that actually
brings us to the end of this amazing
tutorial today you learn how to create
and process manufacturing orders along
with the work orders within them see you
in the next video doers I'll catch you
on the flip side today's snack was I ran
out of snacks I've been eating all day
