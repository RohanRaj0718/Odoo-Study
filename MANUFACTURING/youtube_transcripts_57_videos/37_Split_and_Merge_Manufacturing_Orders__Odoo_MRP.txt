what's up o doers and welcome back today
we're talking about the split and merge
functions in odo's manufacturing app the
split function allows me to split a
single emmo into multiple OS for smaller
quantities on the other hand the merge
function allows me to merge multiple OS
of the same product into a single MMO so
let's jump into the Odo database to see
how this works all right here we are on
the manufacturing app first let's focus
on splitting a single emmo into multiple
smaller Emos to do so I'm going to start
by creating a new emmo which I'll do by
clicking on operations then
manufacturing orders and new then in the
product field I'm going to select our
table product and we're going to create
a quantity of 12 and enter 12 in the
quantity
field then all we have to do is Click
confirm and now let's say we've decided
that we want to produce these 12 tables
using more than just one Mo to split the
current emmo I'm going to start by
clicking the gear icon at the top of the
screen and then selecting the split
option here I can decide how many
smaller MOS the Maino should be split
into along with the quantity of the
product produced in eacho in the split
number field I'll enter how many os the
main emo should be split into by default
a quantity of two is entered but let's
change this to a quantity of three
instead great after doing so a line
appears for each manufacturing order
that will be created showing the
scheduled date the employee responsible
and the quantity to produce each of
these fields are automatically set but
we can change them if we need to so for
the first line Theo is scheduled to be
carried out today by me to produce a
quantity of four
units that looks good so we're going to
leave that as is however for the second
line the first two Fields look good but
I only want to manufacture a quantity of
two for thiso so in the quantity to
produce field we're going to change this
from 4 to
two once I do a warning appears telling
us the total in the quantity to produce
column must match the number displayed
in the quantity to produced field
displayed at the top of the popup window
this ensures we don't overlook any
quantities while splitting orders due to
miscalculations to fix that we'll add
two units to the third line and change
this from four to
six all right for the final line I want
to change change the date of when Theo
is scheduled since I won't have time to
complete it today I can do so by double
clicking on the schedule datee which
will open the calendar popover and from
here I'm just going to select tomorrow's
date and click
apply now I won't be at work tomorrow so
I'm going to change the responsible
person by clicking on the field and a
drop down will appear and here I'm going
to select
Jose all right all this looks good so
let's go ahead and click the split
button at the bottom of the window to
split this
Mo once I do we're automatically taken
to the first page of the three MOS I can
tell this is the first emmo reference
number at the top of the page is because
we have the old emmo number with a 001
following if I want to see all the split
Emos off the old emmo I can click on the
back order smart button and we're taken
to a page that displays all three each
with a three-digit tag added to the end
of the reference numbers to help tell
them apart
all right now that you've seen how to
split Emos let's take a look how to
merge two or more Emos together I can do
this from the back orders page but the
most common way to do this is by
navigating back to operations and then
manufacturing
orders now I can merge as many Emos as I
want but they all have to be for the
same product for example I can't merge
an emmo for a table with another emo for
a chair so let's say I want to merge two
of the Emos I just split to do so I'll
tick the check boxes for the 001 and 002
MOS then I'll click actions at the top
of the
page and then here all I have to do is
Click merge from the drop down
menu once I do I'm automatically taken
to the page for the merged emmo this
emmo is given the first available
reference number the schedule date for
the merged emmo is automatically set to
the earliest date on which Theo can be
processed regardless of the scheduled
dates of Theo that were merged to create
it now if we navigate back to operations
and then back to manufacturing
orders we can see the emmo listed on the
page with the reference numbers of the
OS merged to create it listed in the
source column and that OD doers brings
us to the end of another great tutorial
you now know how to split a single MMO
into multiple smaller OS and how to
merge a multiple MMO into a single MMO
thanks for sticking around and I'll see
you next time
