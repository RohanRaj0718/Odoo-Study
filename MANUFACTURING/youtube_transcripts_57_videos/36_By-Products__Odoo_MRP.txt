what's up B doers as always I'm glad
you're back today we're talking
byproducts and no I don't mean when I
buy products on the internet although I
do love a bit of online shopping
sometimes during Manufacturing in
addition to the product we want to
create an additional product is created
as well take our chair product for
example we need 10 units of wood to
manufacture it while most of the wood
itself ends up in the chair some of it's
left over to form scrap wood in the case
of residual materials like scrap wood it
sometimes makes sense to dispose of them
entirely in that case check out our
scrap orders tutorial to learn more
about that however sometimes byproducts
can be useful in other ways for example
we can use our scrapwood to create
cutting boards by using byproducts in
odo's manufacturing app we can designate
a byproduct on another product's bill of
materials or bomb allowing us to track
the quantity we produce of the byproduct
so let's jump into our database now to
see how it all works all right the first
thing I need to do is make sure that the
byproduct setting is enabled to do so
I'm going to click on configuration and
then down to settings and I'm going to
make sure that the checkbox next to
byproducts is ticked I've already done
so but after you enable it in your
database make sure you to click save
before moving on now let's take a look
at our bomb that I've created for our
chair product I can find that by
selecting products and then build of
materials and then selecting our chair
bomb on the components tab we can see
that the producing chair requires 10
units of wood the chair also requires
two operations to be completed which I
can see by clicking on the operations
tab first I need to cut the wood and
then second we'll use that wood to
assemble our
chair next in the operations tab we have
the byproducts tab this appears because
we enabled a byproduct setting and it
allows us to specify the residual
products that are created while
processing the manufacturing order as I
previously mentioned manufacturing the
chair also creates some SCP scrap wood
so I'll specify that on the byproducts
tab by clicking add a line and then
selecting our scrap wood in the
byproduct
field I know that three units of our
scrap wood will be created each time so
I'm going to enter a quantity of three
here finally we have the produced in
operation field here we can specify
during which operation the product is
created our scrap wood is produced while
cutting the wood for our chair so I'm
going to select our cut wood W operation
for the produced in operation
field all right that's all we need to
worry about for our bomb now let's
produce one unit of our chair product to
see how the byproducts are created so
I'm going to select on products first
and then products once again just so we
can get a hand count of how much chair
units we have as well as scrapwood and
as you can see we have five units of our
chair and 15 units of our scrap
wood now I'm going to click on
operations and then select Manufacturing
orders and select new to create a new M
Mo in the product field I'm going to
select
chair and then simply just confirm this
m
Mo let's go ahead and select the
byproducts
Tab and this is where I can see the
scrapwood product listed you'll also
notice the checkbox in the produced
column is unticked since there isn't a
process yet to create the
scrapwood so I'll do that now by
clicking on the work orders tab
where I can see both of my work orders
and I'm just going to go ahead and click
start for the cutw operation and then
one I'm finished with this all I have to
do is click done now when I return to
the byproducts tab I can see that the
checkbox next to scrapwood is now ticked
confirming that the byproduct has been
created all right let's go ahead and
complete the rest of the mo by simply
clicking produce
all and now if I navigate to products
and then products once again I can see
my up updated onhand count of scrapwood
has increased by three as well as my
chair as expected with scrapwood
available in my inventory I can use it
to produce units of our cutting board
product like I mentioned in the
beginning of this video and that's it
for today folks you now know how to
designate byproducts on a build
materials and how to track the time of
byproducts produced in each
manufacturing order until next time
thanks for watching
