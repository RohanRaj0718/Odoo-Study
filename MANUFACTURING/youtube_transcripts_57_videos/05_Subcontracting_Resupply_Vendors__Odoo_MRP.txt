foreign
we'll be talking about how
subcontracting works when using the
resupply vendors workflow not stealthy
would we partner with subcontractors to
help us complete tasks that can't be
performed internally now this allows us
to focus on our key operations while the
subcontractors perform those other
activities Now using this workflow our
company can diversify our products
without hiring more people or investing
in expensive equipment we're running low
on money now moreover our partners can
provide us with expertise that we can't
always Source from our staff now there
are two primary subcontracting methods
in odoo resupplying and Drop Shipping
now this video will cover resupplying
where we send raw materials to our
subcontractors so that they can
manufacture the finished product and
send it back to us this is advantageous
because it allows us to keep the
finished product in our inventory
without having to make the product
ourselves so enough Chit Chat let's see
how this works in odoo
I heard of doers so first we're going to
navigate over to our manufacturing
application configuration and settings
make sure the little check box next to
over here on subcontracting is checked
off all right now let's configure our
desk lamp and its components which is a
base bulb and shade Each of which we've
already created to save you time so from
the products menu select products and oh
no would you look at that we actually
don't have a lamp in stock or on hand
yet however we have all three of the
components in stock that are required to
manufacture it so I'm going to select
the desk lamp and I want to show you
something real quick I'll do this now
when we select the inventory tab you'll
basically see that since we'll be
purchasing this desk lamp from Super Sub
contractor after the manufacture it I
need to make sure that the Buy Route
over here under operations is selected
now let's create a bomb for that lamp
and just so I can show you how to
configure this so we're going to select
products bombs new one
lamp
and in our case we want to select for
the bomb type subcontracting and when we
do so ODU tells us who is subcontracting
this now I'd like to make make a very
quick note actually about that when we
selected the subcontracting it's so that
Odun knows we won't be manufacturing
this product ourselves you can basically
designate as many as you like and in
this case we've just chosen the one now
moving on we'll add our stuff in our
case what do we have for this lamp we
have a base
Bob
and finally a shade
once that we are all set we save this
and we also want to make sure
additionally that each of these
components is set up to basically be
resupply subcontractor on order and
that's the route that is needed to be
selected under the inventory Tab and
I'll show you what that means go into
inventory make sure that this is checked
off or else it won't work make sure you
check it for each of the components that
belong to a bomb for that now this tells
Odo that we need to supply super
subcontractor with each of the lamps
components every time we order a lamp
from them all right that takes care of
config so let's move on to having super
subcontractor actually manufacture the
desk lamp so we're going to go out of
here go into purchase
create a new RFQ in our case we need a
vendor who did we just say we're using
super subcontractor they've given us a
great deal on a lamp and it is beautiful
once that we're done we save always save
confirm this out and boom we're done all
right now after confirming it I need to
deliver the components to our partner I
can do so through the resupply smart
button that we have up here or I can
also do so from the inventory app so let
me show you that I'm going to go into
inventory and right here we can see it
immediately now from the inventory
overview page I can see that the
resupply subcontractor has one to
process we click into that
and boom there we have it now as you'll
notice on this document line there's a
few bits of information that it tells us
it shows that the delivery address is
basically set to
super subcontractor's address and that
the source from is our main Warehouse
over here now remember we can also print
the delivery slip for this order to
review the full source and destination
addresses by selecting the print icon
after you select the line and print now
that document will give you all the
information pertaining to the delivery
and we can save it for our records as
well
now let's head into that actually oops
go out of there
save sorry about that oh doers little
dupsy will validate this and apply boom
we're done now from the operations tab I
can see that all three components were
reserved already and they're ready to be
sent now once that this has been
dispatched I can actually finish this
off so we'll go back over here where 2o
doers in our case
I want to set the done quantities to
this to confirm that the components have
already been set so let's suppose that
they finish the desk lamp and they've
shipped it back to us by returning again
to the inventory overview you can see we
have one receipt to process we select it
there it is outdoors now on this one
we'll go in there and validate it apply
and by Magic we've received the finished
product now when we take a look at our
products up here over products you'll
see that we now have a lamp in stock and
it's manufactured by removing one unit
from each of our actual products over
here as well and our components have
changed ah beautiful it's ready for a
customer that's it for this video just
like that we've used a subcontractor to
handle production of a desk lamp
eliminating the need to hire additional
workers or purchase expensive stuff be

subcontracting tutorials to learn about
