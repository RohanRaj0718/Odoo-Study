Hello Odooers, and welcome back! There 
is a key element we shouldn’t overlook  
in Stealthy Wood’s manufacturing process: the 
Overall Equipment Effectiveness, also known as  
OEE. OEE is the gold standard for measuring a 
company’s manufacturing productivity. But why  
do we use OEE in a small-to-medium enterprise like 
Stealthy Wood? The reason is simple: OEE helps us  
identify the percentage of truly productive 
manufacturing time across my work centers.  
Identifying productivity losses helps me pinpoint 
areas for improvement, making operations more  
efficient and cost-effective. OEE can lead to a 
significant return on investment, especially when  
we launch a new product. After all, making sure 
that existing equipment is being used efficiently  
reduces the amount of money we need to spend to 
meet our production needs. Keeping an eye on the  
Overall Equipment Effectiveness is vital for when 
trying to reach a company’s true potential. So,  
let’s see how we can take advantage of it in 
Odoo. At first, OEE might seem difficult to  
understand and compute. Luckily, Odoo calculates 
and records these values automatically. That means  
that the complicated steps are taken care of 
in the background while regular production  
operations continue like normal. This is very 
convenient, since not everyone is an expert in  
manufacturing. So let’s hop into the Manufacturing 
application, where I have a dashboard overview of  
my work centers. As you can see, there’s an OEE 
field with a percentage for each of my active work  
centers. Right now, the OEE percentage for each 
work center is in green, which indicates that the  
work centers are meeting their targets. If the OEE 
drops below the target, then the number will turn  
red. For example, I can change the OEE target for 
this work center to be greater than its current  
OEE by clicking on the 3 dots on the top right and 
clicking on Settings. Under Product Information,  
in the OEE Target field, let’s change it to 
100%. Let’s see what happens when I go back  
to my dashboard via the breadcrumbs. Ah, and 
now the percentage is red, since my team didn’t  
reach the OEE Target I set. But let’s cut my team 
some slack, since we don’t expect the work center  
to operate at 100% efficiency. So let’s change 
it back to 90%. I can learn more about my work  
center’s production statistics when I click on the 
Work Center’s OEE button. This helps me identify  
factors that are affecting the work center’s 
effectiveness. For example, we can see that  
this Work Center, Drill Station 1, has been doing 
really well with its “Fully Productive Time”,  
with just a small portion of the total time being 
taken up by “Reduced Speed”. If I want to access  
an overall OEE report for all of my work centers, 
I can go to Reporting subheading at the top,  
and click on Overall Equipment Effectiveness. By 
default, this view is grouped by Work Center and  
Loss Reason. I can even remove some of the 
sections from view. This is a great method  
for visually gauging efficiency. For example, 
let’s click on the “Fully Productive Time” at  
the top of the graph. To further understand 
OEE and how it’s computed, let’s see how it  
changes when it takes longer than expected to 
manufacture a product. I’ll start by opening an  
MO for a Wood Panel that's already confirmed. 
So let’s go to the Operations subheading, and  
click on Manufacturing Orders, and select the Wood 
Panel MO. Then, I’ll go to the “Work Orders” tab,  
and in the Drill Operation, in the “Real Duration” 
field, let's change it to “80.” That’s 20 minutes  
longer than the Expected Duration of 60 minutes, 
which was set on the Operations tab of the Wood  
Panel’s Bill of Materials. Okay, let’s head back 
on the manufacturing dashboard by clicking on the  
Overview menu at the top. And would you look at 
that Odooers! Odoo has automatically calculated  
the new OEE, which has been instantly impacted 
from 95% to 93%. When I click on the OEE link,  
I can see that the work center’s “Fully 
Productive Time” has decreased by just a smidge,  
due to an increase in the “Reduced speed”. If 
I click on the Reduced Speed pie chart segment,  
I am shown a list of every time the loss reason 
occurred. If I want, I also have the option to  
manually create and report a loss reason. 
So let's go ahead and click New. Let’s say  
I experienced a material availability issue that 
wasn’t immediately reflected on the work order.  
So in the Loss Reason field, let’s select Material 
Availability. As promised, everything related to  
the OEE calculation is automatically handled by 
Odoo based on the actions that employees record  
during the manufacturing process. Thanks 
for watching, and I’ll see you next time!
