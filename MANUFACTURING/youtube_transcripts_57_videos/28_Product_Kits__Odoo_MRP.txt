welcome back o doers today we're talking
about how to create product kits using
the build materials feature in the
manufacturing app what is the kit you
ask well have you ever purchased a
product you had to build yourself I'm
sure you know what I'm talking about
maybe you bought a desk that you had to
assemble and spent the rest of the night
fighting with your roommate or
significant other about whether the legs
are screwed on correctly well that
product is known as a kit a kit benefits
manufacturers since they only have to
worry about purchasing or producing the
required component and packaging them
together ODU allows you to add kits to
other bills of materials or bombs which
is useful if the item in the kit are
used to manufacture a variety of
different products in your catalog all
right let's jump into our database to
see how it all works let's say we run a
personal computer business called cows
computers here at cows we sell ready to
use computers as well as computer kits
that customers can assemble at home to
create a kit we need to start by
configuring a build of materials or bomb
I've created a bomb ahead of time so
I'll open that by navigating to the
manufacturing application selecting
products and then bill of
materials and then selecting the
computer Essentials kit
bomb this kit contains three Essential
Elements used in every computer we sell
a power supply computer case and then a
cooling fan in the bomb type field on
the right here I've selected
kit this means that when whenever this
kit is included in a manufacturing or
delivery order it gets broken down into
its individual components now let's
click on products and then products
again then find the computer Essentials
kit you'll notice on the onhand field we
have 100 units of this kit this is
despite the fact that we haven't
actually created one of these kits yet
how can that be you may ask well the one
on hand for a kit always defaults the
number of kits that can be created with
the quantity of components on hand since
we have 100 of each component on hand
for 100 computer cases 100 cooling fans
and 100 power supplies we can create 100
total kits so the onhand count defaults
to that number now for this particular
kit we sell it to customers so they can
build their own computers we also use it
to build computers that we sell fully
built let's see an example of each of
these
workflows first let's sell a kit to a
customer a jump over to my sales
application click new and in the
customer field I'll select our old
friend Jim Joe
Kelly then I'll go ahead and click on
add a
product and in the order lines tab I'll
select the computers Essentials kit in
the product
field all right everything looks good so
I'll click confirm to turn this RFQ into
a sales order or
so after doing so you'll notice the kit
is still the only product listed in the
order lines tab this is what the
customer sees when they receive a copy
of their so however the workers picking
the components of the kit need a little
bit more information than that which is
where the delivery order comes into play
I'll open it now by clicking the
delivery smart button at the top of the
page on the delivery order the kit is
broken down into its individual
components this tells our warehouse
workers that they need to create the kit
by picking each of these components
putting them in the same
package once that's done and the package
has been sent they just need to click
validate to complete the delivery
order pretty awesome but what about
using a kit during the manufacturing
process well one of the really cool
things about kits is that they can also
be added as components to bombs or other
products in the case of our computer
Essentials kit we use all of the
components within it in almost every
computer model we build so instead of
adding these components to every
computer bomb individually we can just
add the kit see what I mean let's jump
back into the manufacturing
app and we'll go ahead and select
products and then build
materials and we'll go ahead and select
our example bomb turbo
computer for this bomb I've actually
added two different kits to the
components tab the computer Essentials
kit contains all the basic compon
components we use in each computer model
we sell and then the turbo computer kit
contains all the components specific to
our turbo computer product with both of
these kits included in the bomb we have
everything we need to build our turbo
computer now let's see what happens when
we use this bomb for a manufacturing
order or ml to do so I'll click on
operations manufacturing orders and then
click on new to create a new
ml in the product field I'll select our
turbo computer
once I do the components tab
automatically updates with all the
components needed to build the
computer as you can see the kits
themselves are not included here only
the individual components within them
the best part is I can continue using
our computer Essentials kit to configure
the bombs for different computer models
for example if we wanted to start
manufacturing a basic computer product
all I would need to do is add the
essentials kit to the new bomb along
with the other required components or a
kit that contains them and just like
that You' made it to the end of another
amazing tutorial you now know how to
configure kits sell them to customers
and use them in manufacturing orders
thanks for sticking around and I'll see
you next time
