what's up OD doers and welcome back
today we're discussing the options for
how many steps to use when processing
manufacturing orders or Os odu's
manufacturing app allows us to process
OS using one two or three steps in one
step manufacturing we only need to worry
about the MMO itself when using two
steps we need to pick the components and
transfer them to the production location
before processing the ml finally for
three-step manufacturing this requires
one additional step which is
transferring the finished product into
storage of course all of these steps
happen in real life for everyo the only
difference is whether or not ODU tracks
the transfer of components and or
finished products so let's jump into our
database to see how this all works all
right when an Odo database is first
created onstep manufacturing is enabled
by default so let's start by looking at
the onstep workflow from the
manufacturing dashboard all we have to
do is create a new emmo by navigating to
operations at the top and then selecting
manufacturing orders and then we're
going to click new in the upper leftand
corner we cover all the basic steps of
creating and processing manufacturing
orders in our manufacturing orders and
work order Basics video so be sure to
check that out if you need a refresher
for this video however this only covers
the details essential for this workflow
so first we need to pick a product that
we want to manufacture and for this
tutorial we'll be producing one unit of
our lamp product so in the product field
I'm just going to select our lamp
we're also going to leave the quantity
field here set to one and go ahead and
click confirm to confirm the
MMO in the chatter if we scroll down we
can see the Readiness of the MMO is set
to ready this is because we have all the
required components in stock this is one
of the key differences between
manufacturing step options in one step
manufacturing confirmed MOS are set to
ready when we have enough components to
complete them when using two or
three-step manufacturing there are a few
extra steps required by before Theo is
ready even if all the required
components are available we'll see this
later in action later in the
video okay since this ammo is already
ready let's go ahead and process it now
by clicking produce all in the upper
left hand
corner and there you have it we've
processed an emmo using onstep
manufacturing now even though we never
processed a transfer of components or
finished product ODU has automatically
registered the number of components
consumed and the product that we
manufactured I can confirm all this
information by clicking on the product
moves smart button at the top and this
is where I can see all the inventory
movements for this specific
Mo this makes one-step manufacturing
ideal for small scale manufacturing
operations companies that don't need to
worry about an excessive amount of
components or products might not need to
worry too much about tracking those type
of
transfers however for many other
companies tracking this operation is
absolutely critical to ensuring that
inventory counts remain accurate in such
case two or three-step manufacturing
would be the best options to use when
processing MOS to enable either of them
I need to head over to the inventory
application and from the inventory
application we'll just hit configure at
the top here and then click on
settings here if we scroll down to the
warehouse section we can make sure that
the multi-step routes operations are
enabled this will allow us to use
multiple steps for a variety of
operations including MOS now if we hit
to configuration and then warehouses and
click into our main Warehouse here in
the manufacturing field I can select the
number of steps needed for
manufacturing since this is set on a
warehouse level it allows companies with
multiple warehouses to use different
settings for each Warehouse in this case
I'm going to select pick components
manufacture then store products or the
three-step
process don't worry the three-step
workflow includes the twostep workflow
within it so we'll be able to see both
at
once let's take a look at them now by
heading back to the manufacturing
application and we're going to create
another MMO for our lamp product so once
again we're going to select operations
manufacturing orders select new up our
left hand corner add our lamp to the
product field and simply click
confirm the first thing I want to point
out is the emo Readiness if we scroll
back down it's no longer ready it now
says waiting another operation this is
because we need to process the transfer
of components to our production location
can open that transfer simply by
clicking on the transfer smart button at
the top of the
page once these components have been
transferred all we have to do is Click
validate to confirm the
transfer then once that's completed I'll
go back to the manufacturing ammo by
clicking the manufacturing smart button
at the top and if we scroll back down
the Readiness of this emmo now appears
as ready since we have all the
components we need
now once the lamp has been assembled
I'll process Theo once again by clicking
produce
all if we were to use twostep
manufacturing the workflow would now be
complete and the onhand count of lamps
would automatically be updated based on
the number we produced however there's
one more step required to complete the
three-step manufacturing workflow
processing the transfer of the finished
product to our inventory so I'll open
that now by clicking on transfers once
again and now we have a second transfer
that appears on this page so if we click
onto that transfer then click validate
to confirm that the product has been
sent to the inventory and just like that
we've completed the three-step
manufacturing process and that brings us
yet to the conclusion of another amazing
tutorial you now know how to process
anmo using one two and three step
manufacturing thanks for sticking around
to the end and I'll see you in the next
video
