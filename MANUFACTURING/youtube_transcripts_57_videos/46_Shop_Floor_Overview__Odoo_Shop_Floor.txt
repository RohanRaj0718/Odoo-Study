================================================================================

welcome back with do my name is Jose
gasio now today I've got a very special
lesson for you about the shop floor
module now here at stealthy wood we
manufacture almost all of our products
and that means we have to deal with a
lot of manufacturing orders further
complicating things is the fact that
most manufacturing orders are split into
multiple work orders now these are steps
that are required to complete each
manufacturing order so with tons of
manufacturing orders that are then
further subdivided into multiple work
orders it's easy to see how things can
get a bit complicated for our
manufacturing
employees anyways that's where the brand
new shop floor module comes into play or
maybe I should say comes into
production the shop floor module
organizes stealthy Woods work orders by
their respective work centers in one
convenient location so enough chitchat
let's get right into
it all right I know you're eager to get
a peek at the shop floor module but
first there are a few things that I need
to mention starting off you should know
that the shop floor is a companion
module to the manufacturing app and this
means that you can install shop Flor by
itself instead you need to install the
manufacturing app first which will
automatically install shop Flor as well
now you may be saying to yourself Jose
I've never seen a shop Flor module
anywhere on my ODU database and I
already have the manufacturing app
installed that's not surprising because
shop floor is a brand new module that's
been added in ODU 16. 4 and later
versions too of course if you're
wondering what version of Odo you're on
it's actually pretty easy to find out
all you have to do is open up the
settings application scroll to the very
bottom and boom your database version
will appear right there if you're not on
version 16.4 or newer and you'd like to
upgrade so that you can take advantage
of shop floor as well as all of the
other cool stuff that we've added I'm
going to link the documentation for how
to do so in the video description below
now the final thing that I need to
mention is that the shop Flor module
replaces the tablet view functionality
and you found that inside of older
versions of ODU now this means you'll no
longer see the tablet view button next
to work orders on a manufacturing order
don't worry though the shop Flor module
still allows you to process work orders
and just like tablet view you can use
shop floor on a tablet or a desktop as
well all right now that we've got that
out of the way let's jump over to the
shop floor module so I can show you how
it makes processing work orders as easy
as one two and
three all right Odo so here we are on
the Odo homepage again now unlike the
old tablet view which could only be
accessed from a work order shop floor is
a separate module and thus has its own
icon so I'm just going to click on the
shop floor icon and we're at the shop
floor dashboard now the dashboard shows
us a card for each manufacturing order
by default we only see emos that are
ready to start according to the search
filter that we have up here if we get
rid of that filter we should see every
manufacturing order regardless of status
let's look at one of our ammo cards to
see what information it gives us and
what it allows us to do so the header
for each card shows the ammo number and
then we also see the product as well as
the number of units being produced and
as well as the status of the ammo in
this case down here in the bottom right
we have a confirmed one however that
will change to in progress once that we
actually start now below the header we
actually see the first work order and
that happens to be over here assembl
table along with a button that takes us
to the work center where these things
are going to be made which happens to be
called assembly line now below the
current work order we see a line titled
register to production I'm going to go
into more detail about how to use this
in the next video but basically it
allows us to record the number of units
we produce and at the very bottom
diverting your attention to this one you
should see a Clos production button
which allows us to close the MMO you
know once that you complete it if you
see the quality checks button instead we
need to perform one or more quality
checks first now once all quality checks
are completed the closed production
button is revealed if I click on close
production you'll notice an undo button
appears
giving you a few seconds you know to
just click undo before the ammo is
closed for Good keeping it open instead
now to the right of that we actually see
an options button and when you select it
a popup appears and this window allows
us to do a few different things we can
scrap a component if it is found to be
unusable for any reason we can also add
a work order or a component now these
options are useful if an extra work
order or component is needed that was
not included in the bill of materials
for the product finally I can click open
backend demo to open the full
manufacturing order in the manufacturing
app very cool all right let's return to
the shop floor app so that I can show
you how it handles work centers and work
orders so back on the shop floor
dashboard let's pretend that I'm Steve
and I'm working on the assembly line and
I only want to see the work orders
assigned to my work center if I want to
view all of the ready to Star work
orders assigned to a specific work
center I can actually click on the work
center button on any of these cards and
boom alternatively I can actually click
on the work centers button up here at
the top like I do with the alternate
paint station and we can go there
directly now if I want to change which
work centers are actually shown up here
at the top all I need to do is actually
click on this little plus button select
one and confirm it out but for now I'm
going to stay on the assembly line work
center just so I can show you a work
order card now much like ano card each
work order card shows us Theo number as
well as the product and the number of
units being produced like we have right
there if work has not yet started on the
work order the card will actually be
tagged with to-do over here now once
work begins this tag will be replaced by
a timer showing the total amount of time
work like we have up here with 10 11 and
some other numbers now below the header
we actually see each of the steps
required to complete the work order now
next to that we may see a button at the
bottom of the card if the work order in
question is basically the last work
order to be completed for the
manufacturing order the button will read
close production now this closes the
entire Mo just like when we click the
same button on any of ouro cards so
it'll look like
that and instead we actually see
something else if there are additional
work orders to complete before the ammo
can be completed the button will instead
read Mark is done like we have right
there which completes the work order but
not the entire MMO last of all we have
an options button just like on ano card
and once you click it some of these
options you'll notice are slightly
different we still have scrap and add
component which behave as normal but
there are a few additional options we
have seen yet so we have move to work
center which is used to transfer the
work order to a different work center
this is helpful if the intended work
center can't be used for any reason
maybe your Steve blew something up we
also have suggest the worksheet
Improvement which allows us to suggest a
change to the instruction shown when
processing a work order in case someone
like Steve doesn't understand something
and we also have to create a quality
alert which allows us to notify a
quality control team about quality
issues if any are found and finally the
block button at the bottom and this
allows us to make the work Center
unavailable just in the event that it
cannot be used for any reason all right
we're going to close out of this just so
I can show you one more thing now if you
check over here what is that well that's
the operator panel and this panel shows
us all the operators signed into the
shop floor module I'm going to go into
more detail about this panel in a later
video so for now just know that it
allows operators to sign into the shop
floor module and log the time they spend
working on each work order all right OD
doers that's it for today lucky for you
this is just the first video in our
series about the shop floor module now
coming up we're going to learn how to
process an MMO using shop floor track
the time our employees spend working on
work orders and so much more so stay
tuned go grab a snack and I'll see you
soon
