welcome back in this video we'll be
discussing how to use the standard price
costing method this video is part three
of my four part series on evaluating
production costs links to the other two
videos are going to be inside of the
description now the standard price
costing method is often used for
production planning purposes or in
situations where actual cost of goods
aren't well defined and an estimate is
more appropriate to use this makes for
more straightforward inventory
management and better cost control at a
high level in odoo the product cost for
standard price comes from straight out
of the products actually therefore the
cost of components for the finished
product must be updated manually on the
product form in this tutorial I'll be
making two tables using differently
price components we'll see that the
product at the end will actually stay
the same as far as costs are concerned
unlike other costing methods and lastly
we'll update costs from the bottom up
that means updating the component costs
first to reflect the accurate cost of
the finished product let's show you some
started from the bottom now we're here
action right now
we'll begin on the overview report for
our final product which is the table so
to get there we're actually going to go
into inventory product product page and
select our table now once that we're
inside of here you want to select this
build a material smart button and we're
going to select it and finally for our
last step we're going to select this
overview smart button up here boom there
we have it now reflected inside of this
bomb overview is four table legs that we
have and a single tabletop with costs at
the ten dollars and five dollars a leg
over here making for twenty dollars
total
and over here we can see that the
product costs on this report correspond
to the cost listed on the product forms
as well and that's kind of Handy and
there's an important note here and that
is that the bomb overview includes the
cost of goods and the cost to operate
work centers as well it does not factor
in labor costs please remember that now
both the finished product and components
follow the standard price method to find
in the product category but how do we
Define that product category well let's
click on our table again directly from
here because ODU is that intuitive
always
all right now look at that we've
actually already set the field over here
that we have which is the product
category and in our case this is
standard and finished good then when we
select that internal link over here it
takes us to a lot more information now
under the inventory valuation you
guessed it right there you can actually
see that we can confirm the costing
method is set to standard price here now
let's actually go back to the bomb
overview through the breadcrumbs which
today is a croissant
for my people who like croissants
they're back over there bill of
materials and there we have it now you
also might notice that for this the
actually we're going to go back over to
the overview fully sorry about that oh
dears you'll also notice that the
product cost itself is actually zero
dollars listed but why is that
that's because that is the default for
new products that don't yet have an
assigned cost in this case I want my
table's product cost to be the sum of
the components and the operational cost
now how would I update the cost of
finished products when using standard
price well I'll tell you when we go to
the tables product form once again
and as you can tell here what are we
going to do our doers and this is
actually going to apply the bomb cost as
the cost of the table because if you see
over there the compute price from the
bottom we're going to do that right
there we're going to select it boom
immediately we have a price now that is
a useful button of doers and with that
the costs are all set here
alrighty odor since I've shown you this
flow in previous videos I actually made
an ammo ahead of time just to speed
things up and to speed things up I've
already confirmed it and applied
everything now the same as before the
green forecast meant that I had
essentially enough to produce a single
table and if we go to the work orders
tab you'll see that I set the expected
duration to be a full hour this ensures
that the hourly labor and Machinery
costs are accounted for even though only
the Machinery costs are used then once
that everything is complete and we look
at this over here through a cost
analysis report you'll see that the
total cost per unit over here has
actually been updated to eighty dollars
total to make the finished product
thirty dollars to buy the components
which we have up here
as the total cost of components and then
finally our cost of operations at fifty
dollars which is the cost that it
essentially costs us to operate our
Machinery at assembly line one it's a
very expensive place
now if you remember earlier this was
actually set the zero before but finally
we have a cost set up and we're going to
talk further about a few other things
and now let me illustrate what happens
when I manufacture a table using more
expensive components so back inside of
manufacturing we're going to select new
and in our case we're going to create an
Mo again and it's for that same table
that we love
and once that everything looks good
you'll actually notice something
immediately oh no we actually don't have
enough components and you can see that
immediately by the red
not available Reserve thing that we have
over here it's basically telling us we
don't have it but don't worry our doers
I can easily order components by going
out of here into the inventory app
and in our case where do we go doers we
go into operations and replenishment if
you haven't watched that video please
watch that video and finally we need to
talk about what we need now if you see
over here the two order and the forecast
columns have been updated with the
demand according to the ammo I just
confirmed I'll select the components
that I need in our case which is this
one and this one and I'm going to select
order over here
boom we're done it was just that easy
now let's say that the component costs
have been fluctuating a lot in our case
everything is getting more expensive
these days they don't tell you why but
it just is that way we go over here and
we look at our purchase order for this
let's assume that this time around our
unit prices have actually been
fluctuating a lot in fact they're
actually now double so what used to cost
five is now the number 10 and when you
use the cost 10 is now the number 20 and
we're basically done here we're going to
confirm this it's so much more expensive
we're receiving our expensive goods and
finally we are validating and applying
this great we have everything and it
cost us an arm and a leg in this case it
literally did
so here's where things get spicy so grab
a drink and start by making sure that
you were in developer mode if you don't
know what that is
please check out our documentation on
how to enter it or please watch a
tutorial on that as well outdoers now
once that you have that set up go into
inventory reporting valuation and over
here we're going to group these by
product and finally we're going to open
up the two that we've been talking about
which is the STD table actually not the
table sorry actual odoopsy we're gonna
open up the table legs and the table top
all right beautiful now once the you
have these all set up you'll notice
something wait a minute the components
are valued according to their original
prices at five dollars a table leg if
you recall earlier and ten dollars a
table top
remember I paid double the price for
them
uh excuse me but is that also another
odoopsy no actually odoo is always right
since we set the valuation method of our
components the standard price they will
always be valued according to the cost
stated on the product form regardless
actually of how much we got price gouge
by vendors but let's take a look at that
a little bit further
forgetting about that for a bit let's
complete the ammo and see how the
production costs are calculated so
inside of the manufacturing app you want
to head over here to operations
manufacturing orders there it is again
now in our case because the components
were restocked the reserve component
status icon itself over here is actually
green now because we have enough now
let's go over here to our work orders
Tab and set the expected duration now
which was 60 also to the real duration
at 60. perfect now that that's all set
up let's mark this as done
and hit apply
and boom we're done
all right now let's check that cost
analysis report again by clicking on
cost analysis and when we go in there
you'll notice the finished product cost
is again it's still eighty dollars the
product and the operational costs are
still the same which follows the
standard price costing method this means
that this cost is always listed on the
product form when we check back to the
table's product form by clicking over
here
go over here to table
and there we are actually there it is
right there as you can tell it's still
eighty dollars calculated using the
standard component cost of five dollars
per leg and ten dollars per tabletop
all right now for our final section
let's say that our company has
reevaluated its purchase reports and
wants to update the product cost itself
we're actually going to go up here to
products
and you guessed it in our case we're
going to go to bomb and we're going to
go to that table itself
all right so once that we're here it's
important to note that the process of
manually updating costs should be done
from the bottom up now what does that
mean remember in order to make sure that
the cost of the finished product
accurately reflects the new component
cost we need to update the components
themselves first then we can use the
compute price from bomb button to
accurately calculate the updated product
cost all right so to update the
component cost to the more expensive
prices we actually need to go to the
individual component product forms so
we're going to first select in our case
the table legs
all right they are five right now we're
gonna manually change this to
10.
now we're gonna go back
we're gonna go to the tabletops internal
link as well and this one as you guessed
it is now 20.
I'm going to go back over here
all right once that you are finished
with all of that what do you need to do
well if you go over here to the overview
report you'll notice it actually changed
right now it's been updated and the bomb
cost have been updated to 110 compared
to the 80 from earlier next we want to
update the product cost so we'll click
on the tables product form in our case
through the little breadcrumbs all right
there we are and in our case we select
the table right there with that little
internal link and finally this is when
we get to actually click this so we're
going to compute and look at that boom
the cost to manufacture table is updated
to reflect the cost of the components
and that's beautiful and there you have
it out doers every manufacturing order
Hereafter will use these costs and they
will be reflected on both the bomb
overview and the cost analysis of mos
that's it for this video for more
information on the fifo costing method
be sure to check out the next video see
you next time outdoers go grab a snack
and if no one's told you this you're
doing great today
