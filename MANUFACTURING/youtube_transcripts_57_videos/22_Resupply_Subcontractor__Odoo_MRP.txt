================================================================================

it's wonderful to see you again OD doers
my name is Jasio today we're going to
take an even deeper dive into
subcontracting so previously we
discussed basic subcontracting in which
a subcontractor is going to be
responsible for obtaining the components
used for manufacturing a subcontracted
product but what about situations where
you want to supply a subcontractor with
the components yourself well that's the
best thing about ODU we offer two routes
to accom Lish that resupply
subcontractor on order and drop ship
subcontractor on order so inside of this
video we're going to be discussing the
resupply subcontractor on order route in
which we send components from our
warehouses directly to the
subcontractor now this differs from the
drop ship subcontractor on order route
in which components are drop shipped
from a vendor directly over to a
subcontractor resupplying a
subcontractor from our own Warehouse
allows us to Outsource the manufacturing
of certain products while still having
control over the inventory counts of the
components needed for subcontracting so
let's not waste any more time and jump
right into the Odo platform to see how
it all works all right in this video
we're going to be using the resupply
subcontractor and Order route to
manufacture one unit of our unic cycle
product so let's begin by seeing how
I've configured the product and its
components to use that route now since
I've already covered all of the general
subcontracting settings in the basic
subcontracting video this video will
only cover the settings specific to
product products that use the resupply
subcontractor on order route if you
haven't already watched the basic
subcontracting video be sure to do that
before we continue it's going to save
you some time I'm going to link it below
now let's click into the inventory
application over here we're going to
select products and products The
Familiar dance and we're going to open
up in our case our unicycle if I can
spell properly today our unicycle
unicycle so inside of here I need to
click on the bill material smart button
up at the top because that's going to
take me where I need to and I'm going to
select the product and remember that we
didn't list any components on the bomb
for the product in our basic
subcontracting video well while using
resupply subcontract are on order we do
need to specify the products components
which you see down here in the
components tab just so that ODU knows
what we need to send to the
subcontractor if you don't do that what
are we going to send as you can see the
components tab over here already has a
requirement of a frame and a unicycle
wheel it's just two components right
there now this is what we're going to
send to the subcontractor after
confirming a purchase order for this
product now once we're done I'm actually
going to go over to the unicycle frames
product page just by selecting our nice
little internal link just to show you
how I've configured both of the
components for this product so inside of
here if we take a quick look we're at
our components product page but I want
the inventory tab over here now again I
talked about routes and here we have it
resupply subcontractor an order right
there there you can see that this is the
operation that we would like to use now
with this route enabled a resupply
subcontractor order will be created to
send this component to the subcontractor
each time that a purchase order for the
unicycle is confirmed all right I've
already configured our other component
in the same way so I don't think I need
to go show that which means everything
is configured the way that we want and
we can move on to subcontracting our
unicycle so the process starts when we
confirm a purchase order or Po from my
acronym lovers to buy the subcontract
product from the subcontractor so to do
so let's head back to our main dashboard
over here and we're going to open our
purchase app now I'm typing again and
select new in the top left corner we got
to start with our vendor so who is the
subcontractor that we want in this case
we're going to pick bike
friends these are always very legitimate
companies by the way so then on the
products page I'm going to click on the
add a product right there and we're
going to start typing in for our
unicycle let it fill out and we're great
we're perfect now all I need to do is
confirm this order and that's the order
of the unicycle from bike friends so
once I click it you'll notice we have
two smart buttons up at the top resupply
and receipt the resupply smart button
opens the resupply subcontractor order
which we will confirm once the unicycle
components have been sent to the
subcontractor the receipt button on the
other hand opens the ORD receipt which
we will confirm once we have received
the manufactured
unicycles so let's start by selecting
the resupply smart button up at the top
to open up our resupply subcontractor
order here we can see that bike friends
is listed as the delivery address over
there and both the unicycle components
are listed in the operations tab this
means we will ship all of these
components to bike friends so once we
ship them I just need to click on the
validate button up at the top just to
confirm that the components have been
sent and once that's done I can return
to the PO by selecting The Source poo
smart button up at the top
so all right it's time for us to process
this let's say I don't know a week has
passed and the subcontractor has
manufactured our unicycle it takes that
long and they've shipped it back to us
so now all we need to do to process the
receipt in which we will enter the
unicycle into inventory I can open the
receipt by clicking on the receipt smart
button up at the top as well or the
receip products button over here we're
going to do that because it seems easier
it saves the screen time so on the
receipt all I need to do is click
validate right
there and the unicycle is entered into
our inventory there you go it's really
that simple well folks that's it for
today you now know how to subcontract a
product using the resupply subcontractor
an order route stay tuned for more
subcontracting videos and I'll see you
next time go grab a snack I actually
have some today jell lime
