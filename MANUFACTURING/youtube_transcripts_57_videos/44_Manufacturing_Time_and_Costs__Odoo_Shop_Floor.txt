hello doers my name is Jose ignasio did
you miss me I know you did because I
missed you and I bet you missed shop
floor even more in that case I've got
some good news for you I'm back today
for More Shop floor schooling now today
we're going to be looking at how
employees can track the amount of time
they spend working on each work order
and we'll also look at an emmo on the
back and to see the total time spent on
its work orders as well as the cost of
processing them you see dear viewer time
is money I mean that quite literally in
this case you know since we're talking
about manufacturing employees getting
paid for the amount of time they spend
working at a work center and I need to
keep track of Steve so if you want a
more granular understanding of your
manufacturing cost it's helpful to be
able to see how much time and in this
case money is being spent to
manufacturer each product that you
produce now luckily shop floor makes it
easy to track how much you spend on each
work order down to the scent so let's
take a look how that works and I'm
watching you Steve all right before we
jump into shop floor I just want to show
you how to set cost per hour for
employees and work centers now this is
important because in order to calculate
how much it cost to process each work
order we need to basically know how much
our work centers cost to operate and how
much we need to pay employees because we
got to pay them a livable wage it's very
controversial so we're going to take a
look at employee cost first so to do so
we're going to click on the employees
app select an employee how about jimjo
okay so here we see the page for one of
our employees jimjo Kelly now jimjo is
stealthy Woods in-house spiritual
advisor and we also have him work the
production line sometimes now to see
where we pay jimjo we actually go into
HR settings and over here at hourly cost
so in this case we pay Jim Joo $40 an
hour I can edit this if I want to but it
looks good for now I also want to make a
note that I have an option for a pin
code up here now this is basically the
code that jimjo will be using to sign
into work centers that he's at in this
case we have a tattoo 1 two 3 4 I think
Jim Joe can remember that all right now
let's see where we can actually set the
cost for our work center so I'm actually
going to return to the main dashboard
select manufacturing and go up to
configuration and work centers um in our
case I'm going to select our paint
station over here great now in this cost
per hour section that we have over here
under the general information tab I want
to talk about something and it's
actually that I can set the hourly
processing cost either per work center
or per employe now what does each mean
well per work center is used to specify
cost associated with operating the work
center like how much it cost to I don't
know use a band saw and operate it per
employee is used to specify how much we
pay each employee per hour to work at
the work center now this is a blanket
cost for every employee meaning you
should only use it if every employee
working at the work center is paid the
same amount I should also note that the
hourly cost field on the employee form
and the per work center field on the
work center form override the per
employee field that we have right there
on the actual work center form unless
they're both set
to0 so for example since I have the per
work center cost set over here to $20
any amount I enter in the per employee
field will be ignored because the per
work center field takes precedence
additionally since Jim Joo has an hourly
cost of as you remember $40 set on his
employee form the cost will be used
instead of the per employee cost that we
have for any work center that he works
at however the per work center cost is
not overridden by the hourly cost on an
employee form so if Jim Joe works at the
paint station his hourly cost of $40
will be added to the paint stations per
work center cost of $20 this results in
a total cost of $60 per hour to operate
the paint station because simple math
all right there's just one more thing I
want to show you on the work center form
so here we actually have an allowed
employees field over here and what does
that basically mean well I can specify
which employees are allowed to use and
work at this work center over here if I
leave it blank any employee can use it
in this case I have it set so that only
Jim Joo can use the paint station
because we don't want somebody like me
painting over here all right I know that
was a lot of information so I think it's
time we go look at the shop floor so
here we are on the shop floor now on the
left hand side we have the operator
panel which shows us all the operators
who are currently logged in at this
moment I'm the only active operator now
I've also already created anmo for our
stool product that I can use as an
example so I'm just going to search for
the product up here and it happens to be
the number 80 just so I can focus on it
all right now I'm going to click on the
assembly line button which takes me over
here to the first work order for the
ammo which happens to be assembling the
stool to get started on it I'll just
click on the header of the card and
you'll notice once I do a timer appears
on the work order showing the total
amount of time it's been worked on by
every employee now next time my name
appear on the operator panel another
timer appears and this one shows the
amount of time that I personally have
spent working during this work session
this timer counts in increments of
minutes so it's going to stay at zero
until a minute has passed all right
let's say that we finished assembling
the stool which means it's time to close
the work order to do that all I actually
have to do is hit Mark is done and then
after I do that some cool magic happens
now the next work order happens to be
painting the stool and we have to wait
for this to fully disappear because
what's going to happen is it's going to
move over to the paint station and
that's actually the work center that we
need to access and we can access it just
by clicking on the word paint station up
here and oh my god oh dupsy oh no the
work order is great
out and I can't interact with it at all
I guess we're just going to have to give
up on manufacturing this
stool just kidding oh my God I
remembered something remember how we
made it so that Jim Joe is the only
employee who is allowed to use the paint
station well since I'm currently signed
in as myself as Jose I can't work on
this or interact with work orders at
this work center so to process this
order Jim Joe will have to sign into the
Shor module and complete it himself so
to do so he actually just needs to click
on ADD operator down here select himself
and oh no again we need his pin his very
difficult pin and boom would you look at
that oders I can now basically work on
this and it's no longer gr out and Jim
Joe can process it so to do so he's
going to click on the header starts the
timer again and then he finished
painting at light speed so he can close
production since he is done now since
this is the final work order for the
emmo both the MMO and work order are
closed so so far we've seen how to set
up cost for work centers and employees
and how to sign into the shop floor app
to record the amount of time spent on
work orders but how do you see the
statistics for the total cost of
processing each work order or even the
total time spent working on them well
it's really hard just kidding it's super
simple I can actually see all of that
from the manufacturing order so let's
take a look at that now to start we're
going to return out of here by hitting
close and we're going to go into the
manufacturing app and you guessed it
operations and Manufacturing orders go
ahead and at this point oh no would you
look at that we can't select ours
because it's been closed so we're going
to take away this filter and go find it
there we have it now I want you to make
your way over to the work orders tab
over here all right now here I can
actually see the total time spent
working on each work order in the real
duration column that we have over there
if I want to see work order cost I just
need to select the overview smart button
up here at the top and boom gives us all
of that over here now the operation
section that we have right here on this
page it basically lists the cost of each
work order in the MMO cost column that
we have over here the time spent on each
work order is also available on this
page in the quantity column that we have
over there as well and there you have it
o doers we covered quite a lot in
today's lesson you should now know how
to record and view the time spent
working on individual work orders you
should also be able to easily find the
processing cost of each work order
that's it for today folks see you next
time
