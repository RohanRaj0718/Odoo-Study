hello again my dear OD doers so excited
that you decided to join me on another
awesome tutorial today we're talking
about consumption and I don't mean
tuberculosis that's something I should
talk to my doctor about no I'm talking
about flexible consumption for
manufacturing components you see
sometimes it's necessary to use a
different quantity of components that is
what specified on the bill of materials
or bomb this is pretty common in
Industries like food service where the
size of specific ingredients may vary
for example let's say I'm making a dozen
suets which normally requires the use of
24 eggs however I wasn't able to get the
extra large eggs that I normally buy so
I had to settle for the regular sized
eggs this means I'll actually need 30
eggs to make my sule in ODU the flexible
consumption feature allows me to use a
different component quantity than the
one specified on my bomb while still
keeping my inventory accounts accurate
so let's jump in and see how this all
works
now the cool thing about flexible
consumption is that we can choose
whether it's allowed or blocked for each
product we manufactur to do so we need
to navigate to the guest it the bomb of
our specific product for that I'm going
to jump to our manufacturing application
click on products and head to our build
of
materials on the Bild of materials page
I'm going to go ahead and search for my
cheese
suet then open up the miscellaneous tab
right right here and here you're going
to notice there's a section called
flexible consumption which includes
three different operations to choose
from if I select the allowed option
flexible consumption will always be
allowed if I select the allowed with
warning section then flexible
consumption will be allowed but users
will receive a warning notification that
requires them to confirm that they're
intentionally using a different amount
finally if I select the blocked option
only managers will be able to close
manufacturing orders for which a
different component quantity has been
used for this video though I'm going to
just go ahead and leave it on the
allowed withth warning option all right
what do you say we make some sus I've
already created a ml for a dozen suls so
let's go ahead and open that now by
heading to our operations and selecting
manufacturing orders and then we're just
going to select the most recent chees
sleo with the lower uho
number on the components tab at the
bottom of the emmo we can see the two
consume that is producing a dozen suets
that typically requires 24 eggs 500 G of
Parmesan cheese and then one liter of
heavy cream now let's use the example
from the introduction and say that we
actually need 30 eggs to fulfill thiso
no problem all I need to do is click on
the quantity field right here and then
enter the number
30 then I need to enable the check boox
in the column
consumed and if you don't see this
column in your database you can enable
it by clicking the additional options
button to the right of the emo Tab and
then enabling the consume check box if
necessary all right now I'm going to go
ahead and close this emmo out by
clicking produce all once I do as you
can see a pop-up window appears titled
consumption warning which requires me to
confirm that I'm intentionally consuming
a greater quantity of components than
what is listed in the bomb this pop-up
window appears because I selected alloud
with warning as the option for the
product's bomb if I had selected alloud
the emmo would be closed out without
giving me a warning the bottom of the
popup are three buttons here the confirm
button confirms that a different
quantity is being consumed on purpose
and then simply just closes out the mo
the set quantities and validate button
goes ahead and reverts the consumed
quantities back to what is specified on
the botb and then closes out the mo the
discard button closes the pop-up window
and then just leaves the emmo open if we
had selected the blocked flexible
consumption option on the products bomb
the confirm button would not appear for
regular users in that case a manager
would need to close the emmo out
themselves but I'll go ahead and just
click confirm to close this out and just
like that we've made a dozen to
plays now if you've watched a lot of our
manufacturing app tutorials then you
probably know that Emos can also be
processed from the shop Flor module if
so you're probably wondering if it's
possible to use flexible consumption in
shop floor as well and the answer is of
course out ofo we really think of
everything to do so you'll need to
create a quality control point or qcp
that creates registered consumed
materials quality checks during the
manufacturing process to create a new
qcp I just need to go to the Quality
application and then I'm going to go
ahead and click on quality control and
then quality control points and then
what we can go ahead and do is Select
this new button here but for this
example I've already configured a qcp so
let me show you how it's configured
first I'm just going to go to the search
bar remove our quality points filter and
then choose our qcp 001
here as you can see we have our cheese
sulle product selected here in the
product form field and we also have in
our manufacturing field in the
operations Tab and then in the mix
operation or the work order operation
field this means that every time a
manufacturing order is confirmed for
ches suls a quality check will be
created for the mix
operation we also have to select the
register consumed materials in the type
field and select
eggs in the product register field as a
result the quality check that gets
created will ask us to confirm the total
number of eggs we use for Theo that's
just a basic overview of how to
configure a qcp for the specific
workflow but qcp behaviors vary greatly
based on the setting of this form so be
sure to check out our quality control
points video for a full overview of all
their configuration options I'll make
sure to link that down below now we're
all ready to produce another batch of
suets using the shop Flor module I've
already created a second emmo to use as
an example so let's go ahead and head
over to the shop floor now
on the card for the MMO I'll go ahead
and collect on or click on assembly
station one and open up the page for the
work center where the mix operation can
be carried out then I'm going to go
ahead and click on egg check right here
to register and open it up in the
quantity field it's currently set to 24
so I'll just go ahead and change this to
30 like we did in the previous example
and click on
validate after that I can just go ahead
and Mark this as done and complete the
work order by clicking to close
production to close
Theo once I do the consumption warning
pop-up window appears just like it did
on the last emmo we processed in the
back end and just like last time I'll
just click on the confirm to close Theo
out now let's go ahead and hop over to
the back end of the
emmo and to do that we're just going to
head over to the manufacturing
applications hit operations and then
Manufacturing orders once again and this
time I'm just going to remove the to-do
filter so see all of our completed MOS
and click on our most recent chiu fle
MMO if we look here we can go ahead and
see in the quality consumed in the
components tab we have 30 units set that
were consumed just like we expected and
that's it for now my dear o doers today
you learned how to use flexible
consumption on OS in both the backend
and Shop floor module stay tuned for
another awesome tutorial but until then
I'll see you soon
