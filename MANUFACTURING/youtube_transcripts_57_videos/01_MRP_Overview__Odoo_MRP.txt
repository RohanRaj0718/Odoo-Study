What's up, Odoers and welcome. In this
video series, we'll follow how materials
are sourced and how products are built
and delivered all on one platform. To do
that, we identify raw material shortages
using the inventory app and create RFQS
using purchase. As soon as parts land,
the manufacturing app can be used to
schedule the work order, balance worker
capacity, reserve components, and track
component and labor costs. Shop floor
operators log processes with one tap,
while quality checkpoints and ECOs's
catch issues early. Maintenance would
then schedule preventative tasks to
avoid downtime, and shipping connectors
print labels and push tracking details
straight off to the customer. And
because every step runs on the same
real-time database, production planners
see true stock, lines stay on schedule,
and orders ship out without any
surprises, which helps showcase the
power of ODO's all-in-one platform for
manufacturing. So, let's walk through
the process, shall
we? So, in most manufacturing workflows,
the process starts with engineering. The
engineers are responsible for designing
the product, typically using a computer-
aided design software or CAD for short,
such as AutoCAD or Solid Works. Once the
design is finalized, the next step is to
create a bill of materials in ODO or
more commonly called a bomb. Think of
the bomb as a recipe for manufacturing.
It lists every component or subasssembly
needed to build the final product as
well as the steps to put it together.
Here's a simple example of a bomb for a
bicycle. While it might look
straightforward, it captures every piece
required to assemble the bike. The
operations are work orders which break
down the manufacturing tasks step by
step that my assemblers follow to
construct the bike. Keep this layout in
mind. We'll be revisiting bombs in more
detail later down the series.
With the bomb in place, we can check the
required components against our onhand
inventory. If parts are short, then we
can auto trigger the creation of RFQS
with approved vendors. And once
materials arrive at the facility, the
inventory team routes each one through a
quality check or straight to its spot in
cold storage, be it on a shelf or in the
overflow warehouse. So to keep the
movement of products in real life
perfectly in sync with the database, we
can also use barcode scanners to log
everything into ODO from product
quantities and especially those
unnecessarily long serial
numbers. With every product, lot or
serial number captured at receipt, the
manufacturing team can step in reassured
that the components listed in the bomb
are truly in stock. Operators pull the
exact components the system reserved. No
hunting, no stockouts. So raw materials
are consumed, recorded, and finished
products are produced. In the cases
where production is outsourced to
subcontractors, say for specialized
parts or overflow demand, ODO can handle
that, too. The database tracks where the
product is with which subcontractor, and
how long to expect to wait until we get
that part built back. So for in-house
manufacturing, ODO tracks real-time
status updates while the assembly line
is running. On the shop floor control
panel, operators press start, pause, or
validate as they work. Each tap updates
the manufacturing orders progress bar
immediately, giving planning a view of
every
operation. Using the planning feature,
we can check every new work order
against the work cent's capacity and
calendar. And if a station is
overloaded, the system automatically
schedules the MMO for the next day
before the shift even begins. This
ensures that all of my orders are on
time and carefully scheduled
efficiently. With every confirmed MMO,
ODO's automatic component reservation
allocates the exact parts right down to
the lot or serial numbers. And this
helps pickers so they see green for
available or red for awaiting supply
long before production starts.
As materials are consumed and labor is
logged, the cost analysis tab rolls up
with material, labor, and overhead in
real time. Managers know the true margin
while the job is still on the line, not
weeks later in a spreadsheet. So far,
we've covered how manufacturing starts
with product design and build materials,
followed by checking inventory and
triggering RFQS when parts are missing.
When materials arrive, all products are
recorded into ODOW. And from there, the
manufacturing app ensures that
components are ready, work orders are
tracked, and production stays on
schedule. ODU handles everything from
planning and progress tracking to
real-time cost analysis, keeping
operations transparent and efficient
from start to finish. But as business
owners know, the story doesn't always
end when the package arrives at the
customer's doorstep. If they find any
issues with the product, some Kairens
might find the customer support team
megaphone in hand, ready to tell us
about all the defects. Once the item's
returned, our quality team can then
inspect the item and begin a new
workflow to improve or repair the
product depending on what's needed. This
entire post delivery process is tracked
in real time so nothing falls through
the cracks and customers stay informed.
First, the quality team would run a root
cause analysis, and if the fix for the
issue is procedural, then they could
simply drop a new quality control point
at reception, picking, or even pre-
ship. A quality control point or QCP is
a predefined check or inspection that is
automatically triggered at a specific
stage in your workflow. For example, we
can add a QCP to inspect the product
before we pack the order to be shipped.
If the issue is related to oversight in
the manufacturing process or is maybe a
design related flaw, we can make changes
to the bomb by creating an engineering
change order aka ECO using the PLM
app. With built-in version control,
teams can roll out design changes in
stages or roll back to a previous
version if needed. That way, assembly
teams are always working with the
correct, most up-to-date bomb with no
confusion or no delays.
Finally, we use the maintenance app to
schedule preventative tasks and log
corrective repairs on equipment. Whether
it's a routine belt check or surprise
motor swap, by staying ahead of
breakdowns, production lines keep
running and delivery promises stay
intact from the moment a product is
first designed to the day it lands in
your customer's hands. ODU connects
every step. You can track it all,
procurement, production, quality checks,
maintenance, and even the final delivery
right from one platform.
And that wraps up our highle overview of
how manufacturing works in ODO. In the
videos that follow, we'll take a deeper
dive into every part of the
manufacturing process, so you can see
exactly how ODU supports every step of
your operations. Whether you manufacture
in-house, use subcontractors, or manage
complex supply chains, ODO brings
everything together in one seamless
platform, helping you reduce errors,
increase visibility, and stay agile.
Now, one of the best parts, ODU adapts
to the way that you already work instead
of forcing you to change your existing
processes. That means you can configure
the system to match your workflows so
your team can stay productive without
skipping a beat. It's more than just a
software. It's a smarter way to
manufacture. And we're excited to show
you how ODU can transform your workflow
and help your business grow. Until then,
I'll see you later.
