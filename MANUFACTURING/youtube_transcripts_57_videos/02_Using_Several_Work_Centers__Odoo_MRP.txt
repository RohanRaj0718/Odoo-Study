what's up oh doers until now we've been
focused on working with a single work
center for our stealthy wood
manufacturing operations however if we
want to scale our production capacity
we'll need to have multiple work centers
in use at the same time now we Face a
common issue that many manufacturers
have to deal with and that is
manufacturing different products
simultaneously across multiple work
centers now in practice if employees
don't want to wait for the main work
center to be available they can actually
manufacture the goods somewhere else but
we still got to keep track of that we
don't want to lose stuff now after all
tracking which work center was used and
when is pretty vital for maintenance
purposes and it you know it enables you
to avoid non-productive time and that's
the worst kind of time oh doers now
luckily and this will always be the case
with odoo I can do all of that and keep
track of stealthy Woods manufacturing
orders by allowing my employees to work
at an alternative work center if the
main one is already being used but this
all gets me excited I always say that so
let's dive into our database and see
what we can you know drastically do to
improve our productivity with multiple
work centers all right there so here I
am on my database and I'm looking at the
manufacturing dashboard now if you
didn't follow my previous videos why
didn't you follow my previous videos the
first thing you want to do then is
enable the work orders feature from the
settings menu so you go up to
configuration and settings and then you
scroll down now once enabled odoo
automatically generates three default
work centers just to get you started
because ODU doesn't leave you hanging
now those work centers are immediately
ready to go you don't have to wait but
to better understand what they are and
how they work you should wait and we
should go do something so let's go
create a new one alright so we can
actually access our work centers through
this link under the work orders settings
over here or you can also do it from the
work centers menu under configuration
now to make a new workcenter we'll click
on new
let's name this one alternative assembly
line with the reference code and this is
important AAL for easy identification
because as you know Jose Ignacio he
loves his acronyms now I can actually
customize the production information
here and for this workcenter if I want
to add values for efficiency capacity
setup cleanup and all those types of
things I can do so now if you'd like to
know more about how these values affect
manufacturing times please check out our
other tutorials on the subject you know
and that will also be linked now since
we are going to set up this work center
to be alternative to assembly line one
it needs to have the same equipment we
don't want to leave people hanging on
that so I'm actually going to go to the
equipment Tab and add the same Machinery
in this case so we're going to add a
line I'm going to select you gotta have
a Samsung monitor
and then we need a saw
and some other stuff and then we're
gonna save manually because I want to
make sure this saves now without taken
care of let's go to our list of work
centers so we're going to actually just
use our breadcrumbs over here and today
we're dealing with a nice sourdough from
San Francisco at my boss's favorite
Bakery and we're gonna jump into
assembly line one and now we're going to
designate the work center we just set up
as the alternative work center to
assembly line one and that's all we had
to do now
once that you're done there manually
save save everything always save I
always feel bad when someone loses stuff
please save
now this workcenter has a capacity of
one which means it can only handle one
manufacturing order at a time now we'll
actually go back to our manufacturing
dashboard to see this new work center
over here now
we can also see that there's something
in progress at assembly line one and
that means one of my employees is
already using that work center and I
don't know how you feel about that but I
want to actually kind of see that so
let's see what happens when I plan to
manufacture something that would
typically use the same work center so
we're going to manufacture the large
meeting table which I already created a
bill of materials for or a bomb bom for
my acronym lovers now that requires the
use of assembly line one now to do that
I'm actually going to create a
manufacturing order for one large
meeting table they're going to go into
our operations manufacturing orders
follow me here new one large meeting
table and confirm alright then I'm
actually going to jump over to the work
orders tab just so that we could see
what's going on there now we see that by
default the Warwick Center that was
selected for assembling this item is
assembly line one but we can actually
turn to the work order and when we hit
plan the work center changes because
assembly line one is already being used
you see that once that you do that Odo
saves you the time so if we want to
manufacture this item we're actually
going to need to use the alternative
assembly line over here and that work
center is the one that we had just set
up now if we go back to our dashboard
over here we'll see that we have the
work you know the work orders all ready
to go and it's ready to be launched
inside of the alternative work center
and that is beautiful that is exactly
what we need in this situation now there
you have it oddures
now you know how to handle several work
centers and you can even organize your
manufacturing areas and eliminate
non-productive time now that's all for
now thanks for watching and this was
just a quick tutorial just to let you
know I got you have a great day
