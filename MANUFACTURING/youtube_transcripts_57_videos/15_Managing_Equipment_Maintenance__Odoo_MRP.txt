================================================================================

hello o doers and welcome back today I'm
going to show you how to use ODU to
schedule preventative maintenance which
is used to avoid high cost and time
losses we can also perform corrective
maintenance to fix things that are
already broken here at stealthy wood
preventative maintenance helps keep our
manufacturing equipment in tiptop shape
if not correctly managed Machinery can
break down or M function causing
unscheduled downtimes production stops
and significant emergency repair costs
nobody wants to deal with wasting money
on major breakdowns so that's why we
encourage regular maintenance on your
equipment I think most facility managers
would agree with me when I say
maintenance matters so without further
Ado let's jump into the
video let's go ahead and start in the
maintenance application where I have an
overview of my maintenance teams I'm
going to go to the equipment menu here
at at the top where I have access to my
work centers quick reminder work center
is a place where workers use machines
and tools for
manufacturing first let's take a look at
these machines and tools by clicking on
machines and
tools over here we can see all the
equipment listed on the menu let's go
ahead and take a look at our first
Samsung
monitor on the equipment form I'm going
to click on the equipment category I can
select the category this piece belongs
to additionally I can also select who
this monitor is used by we can also
change who's in charge of the
maintenance and it looks like our trusty
internal maintenance team is already set
I can also see the equipments aside work
center and location I can also add a
description at the bottom here when I
click on the product information tab we
can see more specific information like
the serial number and warranty
expiration date now let's check out our
maintenance tab
here we can arrange how often we want to
have preventative maintenance as well as
how long it takes I'm going to go ahead
and set the preventative maintenance
frequency to one day and I'm going to
set the maintenance duration to half an
hour we can also set up an expected
meantime between failure or mtpf for our
acronym lovers below that ODU
automatically calculates the mtbf value
based on previous maintenance request
as well as the estimated next failure
and meantime to repair based on this
equipment's performance
data with the expected mtbf all set we
can tell ODU how often we need to
perform maintenance with the real mtbf
ODU tells us how often the maintenance
fails and needs repairs for a monitor
let's say the expected mtbf value is 100
and 20
days and once we have an actual
equipment failure the latest failure
field will display the date of that
failure the field above that will tell
us when the estimated next failure date
is which is based on historical data
this helps us prepare accordingly and
switch up our maintenance schedule to
repair the equipment before that
happens lastly the meantime to repair
field or mttr measures how long it takes
us to complete a maintenance request for
this equipment when a failure occurs
again that'll automatically adjust based
on real data as it becomes available in
ODU I know that was a lot oders but to
wrap this all up ODU will automatically
generate a maintenance request if we've
defined a preventative maintenance
frequency these requests are only
generated once daily so don't be alarmed
if the request isn't generated right
away all righty let's view our work
centers by navigating to equipment and
work
centers I'll check out assembly line one
under the equipment tab we can see all
of the equipment used at this work
center and they're computed meantimes
between failure and meantimes to repair
I can also add equipment here if I want
to at the adline section if I click on
this X on the right I can remove pieces
for example if they're outdated or being
replaced now that we've reviewed where
to find machines equipment and work
centers let's create a maintenance
request
let's go ahead and head to our dashboard
here I have three preconfigured
maintenance teams let's go ahead and
create a maintenance request for my
internal maintenance team by clicking on
the Zero Todo
button like other teams in ODU each
maintenance team has its own unique
pipeline let's click new to create a
maintenance request
manually and I'll say one of our
printers is
jammed
then let's select the cor corresponding
piece of equipment let's say the HB
inkjet
printer all righty since this is an
active issue that needs to be fixed I'll
ensure that the corrective maintenance
type is
selected I can also tie a specific
manufacturing order to this maintenance
request I can also schedule a date for
the fix when I click on schedule date it
will show a calendar and I'm going to
select today's date and click
apply all righty for the duration let's
set it to 1
hour and this is a super super super
important request so let's mark it as
three stars in the
priority and if we have any additional
information we can type it right here in
the description field and boom we've
just created a maintenance request when
I click on the maintenance request
breadcrumb the request is shown at the
dashboard during manufacturing equipment
hiccups may occur and sometimes it may
be more convenient to create a
maintenance request directly from a work
order now let's walk through creating a
maintenance request for a beastro table
while in the middle of a manufacturing
order I'm going to head to our
manufacturing app and then I'm going to
go to the operations menu and
Manufacturing orders and I'm going to
click on our m o for our bastro table
now I want to start a work order for
this bistro table so I'll click on the
work orders Tab and then I'm going to
click on this blue external link arrow
on the right that says open work order
this will open a pop-up window with a
smart button that says open shop floor
let's go ahead and click on
that all righty now that we're here in
our shop floor app we can see our emmo
for the beastro table right here to
start production we'll just click on the
title of Theo at the top here you can
see that we're executing this emmo at
assembly line one in the emmo itself we
can see the work order steps so we've
got four steps for this particular work
order table supports table legs register
production and print labels let's hop in
and start the first
step all righty so we have a few things
here telling us what to do we have the
WR instructions and the visual
instructions pretty cool right I'm going
to close out of this tab and indicate
that I want to go to the next step so
I'll complete this step by clicking on
the check box in the table support line
let's check out our next step here we
have new instructions specific to the
table legs it lets us know how we need
to attach the legs to the rest of the
table I've got Lightning Fast hands so
I'm going to say I finished this this
step by clicking on the next button done
what's nice too is that ODU moved us to
the next step in the work order which is
register
production now OD doers we track our
popular beastro tables with unique
serial numbers to do that we need to
enter the produced quantity which is one
and then we can click on the big blue
plus button to generate and assign a
brand new unique serial number boom
we're all set here so let's go ahead and
click
validate and yay we're on our final step
of our work order but wait a second our
table I think is a little uneven so
we're going to need to shave down one of
these legs by using a scrub plane which
is conveniently located at our work
center so I'm using the scrub plane but
something's just not right I'm going to
need to request a maintenance for it so
I'm going to do so by clicking on the
three dots icon here at the bottom right
of Theo and I'm going to click on the
request maintenance button a pop up for
a brand new request appears let's go
ahead and fill this bad boy out I'm
going to call this maintenance request
scrub plane blade needs
replacement for the equipment I'll put
the scrub
plane all righty and the maintenance
type is going to be set as corrective
and the assigned team is internal
maintenance looks good for the schedule
date I'll put today and click
apply and for the duration we're going
to be setting it to 1
hour and obviously we're super high
priority so the priority is going to be
three
stars everything looks good so let's
save this maintenance
request all righty now that the Quest
EST is in let's pause production for now
by clicking on the title of the M Mo and
the timer stops ticking the operator
filling out this maintenance request
will need to keep the work order paused
until the equipment is ready to use so
let's go ahead and take care of that now
and we can click close at the top right
corner over
here let's go back to my internal
maintenance team by going to the
maintenance app on the internal
maintenance team I'll click on the two
to do
button all righty and let's go into the
scrub plane maintenance request that we
just
created once the responsible maintenance
team member addresses the request they
can move it to the repaired stage here
at the top right this will notify the
request's followers Additionally the
repair person can use the chatter to
message the operator to resume
manufacturing let's go ahead and Mark
this maintenance request as done in the
the
chatter yay now that our equipment is
repaired production can begin again for
the beastro table we were working
on before we wrap up I'd like to make a
quick note that if I want an overview of
all maintenance requests not just for
the internal maintenance team but for
all maintenance teams I can also view a
calendar of all the tasks by heading to
the maintenance here at the top of the
maintenance
calendar here I can see the scrub plane
maintenance request I just submitted we
can also switch to different views here
at the top right for example using the
camben view will allow us to see what
stages the maintenance requests from
every team are in not just the internal
maintenance team so we can manage all
requests easily using the drag and drop
cards other helpful views here are the
list and graph view the list view will
show all of the maintenance requests in
a list along with those requests
metadata the graph few has a visual
breakdown between the stages that the
requests are in which can be pretty
handing for reporting
purposes so there you have it OD doers
now of course corrective maintenance
should be avoided as much as possible
and you should always try to put
preventative actions in place but
sometimes you don't have a choice
luckily ODU helps you process both kinds
of Maintenance in efficient and timely
manner thanks for watching oers and see
you next
time
