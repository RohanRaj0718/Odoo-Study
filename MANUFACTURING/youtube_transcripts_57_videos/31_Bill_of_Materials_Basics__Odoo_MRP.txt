how's it going o doers it's wonderful to
see you as always today we'll be diving
into the basics of build materials or
bombs you see in order for a business to
manufacture a product the employees need
to know the steps or operations required
to create it and the components needed
to do so this is where a bomb comes into
play a bomb contains everything we need
to know to manufacture a specific
product take our bookshelf product for
example to assemble our bookshelf we
need four shelves two side panels and
eight screws putting all of that
together requires one assembly operation
carried out at our assembly line work
center now it wouldn't make sense to
have our employees keep all that
information in their heads so we need to
put it in a bomb so they can reference
each time they build a bookshelf let's
jump into our Odo database Now to create
our bookshelf bomb all right here we are
in the manufacturing app first thing we
need to do is make sure that the work
orders feature is enabled this allows us
to add operations to bombs and specify
the work centers where they should be
carried out so I'll head to
configuration and then settings and we
want to make sure that the checkbox next
to the work orders option is ticked
great I've done so already but make sure
to click save once you enable it in your
database now let's take a look at the
product we'll be using for today's
example the bookshelf so to access that
I'll click on our products option and
then products once again and select our
bookshelf card now on the product form
I'm going to select the inventory Tab
and make sure that the manufacturer
route is enabled in the route section
enabling this routes tells Odo that the
product can be manufactured which allows
us to create manufacturing orders or MOS
for it all right we're all set to
configure a bomb for this product so to
do so I have two options first I can
navigate to products and select the bill
of materials option this page shows me
every bomb configured for any product in
my database so to create one all I have
to do is click the new option in the
upper left hand corner now second I can
create the bomb directly from the
product form so let's return to the
bookshelves form to use that method and
once again we'll select products
products again and then click on that
bookshelf
card now on the form I'll click the bill
of material smart button at the top and
this opens a new page where I can create
every bomb created for this specific
product it's important to mention that
you can create as many bombs as you want
for a single product and that the bomb
that's listed first on this page is the
one that's selected by default for Emos
now let's create a new Bomb by clicking
new and since we navigated to this bomb
from the bookshelf's product form the
product is automatically selected in the
product
field in the quaity field here I can set
the quantity of the product that the
bomb is used to create but we're going
to leave it for one for this example
in the reference field I can enter a
code that will distinguish this bomb
from others created for the same product
and below that we have the bomb type
field since we want to manufacture the
bookshelf I'll leave it to manufacture
this product there are a few other
options that can appear in this field
but we'll cover those in other videos
now let's focus at the bottom for the
top of the form and first we have our
components tab which allows us to
specify the components needed to
manufactur the product along with the
required quantity of each I'll add the
first component which is our
Shelf and to do that all we have to do
is Click add a line type your component
and select in the drop- down menu in the
component field then in the quantity
field here I'll go ahead and enter
four cool and I'll also go ahead and add
the rest of the components which is two
side panels and eight screws
now let's move to the operations tab
where I can specify the operations
needed to build the bookshelf the
assemble operation so I'll go ahead and
do that by clicking add a line and this
create an operation popup window appears
in the operation field I'll just go
ahead and title this Assemble
then I'll select the work center where
the work is carried out and the work
center field below which will be our
assembly
workstation and in the two fields to the
right I can choose the duration of how
the operation is determined if I click
compute based on track
time ODU calculates the duration based
on a certain number of the most recent
work orders which I can specify in the
based on field right
here however I'll just set it to set
duration manually which allows me to
enter the specific duration in the
default duration field below I know it
takes about half an hour to assemble the
bookcase so I'll go ahead and type 30
right
here and finally we have a worksheet tab
that appears at the popup here at the
bottom now I can include instructions
for how to perform the operations in
either a PDF Google slide or text format
luckily I have got a PDF already so I'll
go ahead and select a PDF option and go
ahead and upload my file through my
computer's file manager
all right that's it for this operation
if I wanted to add another I could go
ahead and click save and new but since
this is the only one I'll go ahead and
click save and close
instead and just like that the assemble
operation has been added to the bomb now
we can create a MMO for this bomb and
use it in the manufacturer process of
the product to do so I'll go ahead and
navigate to operations and click on
manufacturing orders then simply click
new now on the Blanko form I'll select
our bookshelf
product and after doing so the bill of
materials field automatically populates
with the associated
bomb in addition the required components
automatically appear on the components
Tab and the required operations on the
work orders
tab now when a manufacturing employee
looks at this ml they'll see all the
information they need to assemble the
one unit of the bookshelf and that
brings us yet to another close of an
incredible tutorial you now know all the
basics of bomb configuration which puts
you well on your way to producing
products using the Odo manufacturing app
thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time
