foreign
hello doers it's stealthywood we
subcontract some of our manufacturing
operations to bolster production without
having to invest in expensive machines
or staff were broke so letting
subcontractors handle some of our
production allows us to focus on other
tasks now today I'm going to give you
the 4-1-1 on Drop Shipping which is a
method retailers or manufacturers can
use to sell Goods to customers without
receiving storing or shipping the items
themselves Now by ordering directly from
subcontractors or suppliers our company
can have products shipped directly to
the customer Drop Shipping is a
convenient way to free up inventory
space and avoid costs associated with
handling and storage now with just a few
clicks we can configure A Drop Shipping
route so that we never have to
physically manage raw materials or
finished products now in today's example
we're going to configure two kinds of
drop ships first We'll order raw
materials to be sent directly from the
vendor to the subcontractor then once
the subcontractor finishes manufacturing
they will deliver the finished product
to the customer now this means the raw
materials and finished products never
enter our warehouse so let's get this
Drop Shipping party started
all right Honduras so first things first
we need to make sure subcontracting is
activated in the manufacturing app
setting so configuration settings scroll
down actually in this case it's right
there subcontracting is checked off now
up next we also want to make sure if we
check under purchase and at the very
bottom over here that Drop Shipping is
also checked off over there we need both
of them now let's go to the bill of
materials for our example product the
stealthy Wood Lamp so in our case we're
going to go to products fill the
materials stealthy with lamp all right
we need to check a few things we need to
First make sure that the bomb type is
set to subcontracting and that we have
at least one subcontractor listed and
next we need to ensure that our
components are set up properly so we're
going to select one of them just to
check it out using the internal link
we go to the inventory tab you want to
make sure that this Dropship
subcontractor on order is selected over
here now this is essentially just so
that we have it activated for the routes
we also have the designate a vendor over
here under the purchase uh tab which is
basically going to be awesome vendor now
essentially what we also see here is a
delivery lead time now this is the time
it takes for the vendor to deliver the
components to the subcontractor here we
can see that our vendor will take four
days to get everything to our
subcontractor now I've already set up
the same vendor and delivery lead time
for the rest of the components so let's
go back to our breadcrumbs and we
actually have to make sure that the
actual product is set up properly so we
will also go over here to inventory for
it and inside of the inventory tab we
need to make sure that Dropship is
selected and we also need to ensure that
the lead times are properly configured
in our case let's say it takes six days
for the subcontractor to manufacture the
final product that's the manufacturing
only time you see over here but the
customer lead time itself is 12 days
over here and that is the number of days
it takes for the customer to receive the
product after they place the order we
know that it takes four days for the
subcontractor to receive the components
and six days for them to manufacture the
lamp we also know we'll take an
additional two days to ship the lamp to
the customer added together by basic
math that's 12 days right there for the
customer lead time now finally we need
to go over here to the purchase Tab and
make sure that our subcontractor is set
as the vendor as well in our case super
subcontractor
and as well as that we also need to make
sure that the subcontracted checkbox is
enabled as well that you should see
and then once that that is actually set
up everything is pretty much ready to go
and you if you don't see it by the way
in our case you need to make sure that
it's checked off and over here you can
select the additional View and there's
also other options here I just realized
you can see that sorry your doers but as
you can tell everything is done and what
this basically does is it tells Otis
that the subcontractor will ship the
item to the customer when we purchase it
instead of us sending it so once that
that's all set up and we confirm that
the delivery lead time is set as 12 days
over here you know since we know this is
how long it will take for the customer
to receive the item it's good to double
check these things but let's see what
this looks like when a customer places
an order
all right we're gonna go into the sales
app and create a new quotation for Deco
addict and our product is that Lampo
doers beautiful once that this is all
done we confirm it now if we check over
here to the other info tab you'll notice
that we actually haven't expected
delivery date we can confirm that it is
12 days from today now since we're Drop
Shipping this product a RFQ for the lamp
was automatically created when the sales
order was confirmed it would actually go
to it by selecting the purchase smart
button up here in the top right and we
can check out a few bits of information
now this document tracks our purchase
from our partner super subcontractor now
the expected arrival date also
corresponds to the 12-day customer lead
time that we set up and we can actually
see that right over there and 100 on
time delivery because we're that
excellent now we can also see that the
delivery is set to drop ship over here
and on top of that the Dropship address
is Deco addict and that's beautiful now
what happens well we when we confirm
this order
you'll notice one Dropship document will
be created which we can view by clicking
on the Dropship smart button up here and
we're in there now let's head on over to
the purchase app because I have
something to show you here so we're
going to go in there
beautiful now here we can actually see
immediately that there's a new request
for quotation has been created for the
component so we're going to select it
from awesome vendor now these components
will be bought from awesome vendor and
directly delivered to Super
subcontractor now the expected arrival
date as you can see over here is 524
which reflects the four days delivery
lead time that we set up for our
components now after we confirm this
order
you'll notice we'll see another drop
 document that again was created so
we'll select it and in this document we
see a smart button which links us to the
source purchase order over here now this
is the original po we created for the
finished lamp it's all comfortable
Circle low doers so let's process this
let's go to our inventory application in
this case I'm going to go in there and
here we see that we have two drop ships
to process in our case we have the one
for the subcontractor and the one that's
just the regular one now first we'll
process the component delivery that's
due in four days so we're gonna do the
subcontractor first in our case what do
we do let's say that the four days have
passed and super subcontractor lets us
know that we have received the
components already so I'll go ahead and
I need to basically validate this one so
we give it a quick application there
boom and we're done now for peace of
mind we can confirm that the components
are registered is on hand in the
location I've set up for subcontractors
by going up to configuration and
locations now we'll Select Physical
locations and boom when I click on the
current stock
we can see that they are all there
awesome this means the subcontractor
received the components and can
manufacture our lamp for the customer
remember that they usually take about
six days to complete the lamp and to
deliver to the customer even though we
don't physically store these parts in
our warehouse it's important to keep
track of where the parts are and how
many so that we can keep track of any
you know subcontracted orders and ensure
that we have nothing but happy customers
who receive their products on time now
finally we need to process the second
drop ship we've received a notice from
Super subcontractor has shipped the lamp
and that the customer has received it so
we're going to head back to our
inventory overview and we're going to go
over here to the Dropship the process
now we'll select it and what do we do
I'll do is well
we're going to go in there and validate
this apply
boom just like that we've successfully
sold sub manufactured and drop shipped
the lamp without ever touching it ah
there you have it odor saving time and
space has never been easier now that you
know how to drop it's like
you need a drop ship it like it's hot so
I hope you have a very
hot day and remember to grab a snack
