hey hey hey what's going on o doers
today I'm going to show you odo's
barcode app and how it can help
facilitate the manufacturing process
specifically we're going to see how ODU
lets you scan barcodes to open process
and cancel manufacturing orders or Os
using barcodes to open OS is more
convenient if you don't want to mess
around on a tablet in the middle of a
building process imagine if while on the
shop floor you had to go to your
computer every time something was being
produced in order to track the
components sounds pretty impractical but
with a scanner you can stay with the
production team and simply scan the
components as you're building the
finished product now that you know how
odo's barcode app can help you with
manufacturing let's see how it works
there's one quick setting we need to
enable to scan barcodes so I'm just
going to hop into my settings
application and click on inventory in
our left side navigation menu once we're
here we're just going to find the
barcode section and we want to make sure
that the bar code scanner setting is
enabled this looks fine so I'll head
back to our main Odo
dashboard one of the coolest Parts about
the barcode app is that you can process
orders without entering the
manufacturing app that said I'll show
you how to create a new emmo just as a
refresher so let's head to the
manufacturing app and in a make to order
manufacturing situation Emos are
triggered when a sales order is
confirmed but at stealthy wood we like
to have a safety stock for our most
popular products so we often generate
Emos manually to access my manufacturing
orders I'm just going to click
operations at the top followed by
manufacturing orders and this shows us
all the existing emos that we currently
have to create a new one I'm just going
to click new at the upper leftand
corner lately we've been selling out of
our floor length Teakwood mirrors a lot
of people will doing last minute bit
checks slay so I'm going to set the
product field to Teakwood
mirror and let's say we need to produce
around 10 mirrors so I'm just going to
update this quantity here to
10 as you can see ODU populates the
components that are needed to make this
mirror based off of the build materials
selected it also shows how many of those
components will be used to make this
product everything else looks fine so
I'm just going to click confirm here in
the upper leftand corner for this
Mo now we hav't an official Mo number
and when I click this gear icon here at
the top I can go ahead and print this
production order I'll need this later on
to scan my Emo's barcode so make sure to
print
this give me one minute I have to go
borrow my friend's
printer all right now that I have my
os's barcode ready let's head to the
barcode
app the first step of the manufacturing
process in barcode is to find the right
manufacturing order there are two ways
to achieve this through the barcode app
first we we can click this operations
button and then the manufacturing card
and this shows us all of the emos in our
system and all I'd have to do is click
the one that I want to process or I
could go back to the barcode dashboard
via the breadcrumbs and use my handy
dandy barcode scanner to scan
ouro what we see here are 10 mirrors
that we want to manufacture
as well as the components from the bill
of
materials now at this point in the
manufacturing process we want to build
the mirrors while I'm actively building
the mirror I'll register the components
I'm using to keep track of them there
are a few different ways to do this
including just by clicking this plus 10
button here on the right or most likely
you want to use your Barcode Scanner so
I'll just scan the barcode of our mirror
and that'll register the production of
these mirrors

to learn more watch our tutorial on
consuming and scrapping components using
barcodes before we officially close this
emmo you should know that you can also
cancel Emos from this screen click on
the gear icon at the top right and you
can see the the last button in here
allows you to cancel the mo but we don't
actually want to cancel this so I'm just
going to use the back arrow to get back
to this screen and great now we're ready
to close out the MMO so I'm just going
to click produce
all and then we receive a message saying
the emmo has been validated the mirrors
have now been put together and are on
the shop floor talk about vanity
projects don't forget to check out our
tutorials and documentation on
manufacturing order ERS thanks for
stopping by and I'll see you next time
