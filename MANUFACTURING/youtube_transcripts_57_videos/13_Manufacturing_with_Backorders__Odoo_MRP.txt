================================================================================

hello doers and welcome back in some
cases we don't have enough components on
hand to produce all of the items listed
in a manufacturing order now when that
happens Odo allows us to create a back
order for the remaining products so that
we know they still need to be
manufactured now when manufacturing an
item uses the three-step manufacturing
process we can create backorders at each
step of the process picking
manufacturing and transferring I'm glad
that's all three now since ODU
integrates operations across its apps
back orders are easily created and
tracked throughout the platform now in
this video I'm going to demonstrate how
back orders can help us get back on
track with manufacturing demands and
inventory levels so enough chitchat
let's jump right into our ODU
database so before following this flow
make sure that multi-step brouts is
activated in your inventory settings and
three-step Manufacturing is selected for
your warehouse for more details on this
check out the tutorial on manufacturing
and two and three steps which I'm going
to link below now while we don't need to
have three-step manufacturing selected
since ODU is going to create back orders
for one or twostep manufacturing we are
going to use it as an example since it's
the most complicated manufacturing
workflow so here we are on the main
dashboard now today let's check out what
we'll be manufacturing and that's our
bestselling product which happens to be
a tambourine so go into manufacturing
products and products select that
tambourine and go into the build of
materials real quick all right so as you
can tell this instrument is made up of
one frame six dowels and 12 zills what
is a Zill you may be asking yourselves
it's those small little metal discs that
make it go jingle
jangle all right now let's create anmo
so we're going to go up here to uh
operations manufacturing orders and
select new we're going to select that
tambourine right there and keep an eye
on that two consume column because we're
going to be making two of these bad boys
today and would you look at that once
that we added a quantity of two a red
graph icon appears over here in the two
consume field letting us know we don't
have enough of those components but what
happens when we confirm this well even
further than that our component status
tells us it's not available and If you
divert your eyes over here to the
reserved column it happens to say not
available as well further confirming
that we don't have all the products
needed to complete the full Mo a smart
button also appears for two transfers up
here now you'll notice there are two of
them one of them happens to be for
picking over here and the other one is
for the transfer of the assembled
tambourines back into the stock let's
take a look at that picking transfer
first okay now this is where all the
magic happens now since we don't have
all the components available to produce
two tambourines Odo reserves enough of
each to produce just one as you could
tell over here let's go ahead and
validate this and then apply this over
here oh and would you look at that is
that magic as you probably guessed ODU
already knows that we picked fewer
components than we needed for the fullo
to address this a popup has appeared
that tells us we need to create a back
order if we want to this splits the
picking operation and lets me pick only
the components that I do have on hand so
we're going to select create order over
here boom now this transfer is now
marked as done up here in the top right
corner let's go back to the mov of the
breadcrumbs which today is wonderbrad
because you're all wonderful every time
and now we see that there are two
transfers that we have or sorry three
small o dupsy it went up by one now
that's because ODU created a new picking
operation for the remaining components
that we don't have on hand yet as you
can tell right there with the new
waiting one before the one that we just
finished that's pretty cool right but
we're going to come back to that later
so here we are back on the manufacturing
order we've picked enough components to
manufacture one tambourine but we still
don't have the quantity needed for both
as you can tell with our not available
still there so what we can do is change
the quantity on thiso so that we only
manufacture one tambourine by changing
it over here to one all right and now
that we're done we'll click on validate
up here now once again we are prompted
to create a back order for the remaining
tambourine that we need to manufacture
so we're going to do that once again now
we have a smart button over here for two
back orders one that is actually done
and completed and one that is awaiting
component so it's just confirmed right
now and it's telling us it's not
available so let's check our transfers
Again by clicking on the breadcrumbs for
the second demo and then selecting the
transfer smart button again so we're
going to select that and select our
transfers now inside of here we can
actually see that the transfer from post
production to our stock is actually
ready down there why since we
successfully made manufactured one of
our tambourines we can transfer the
finished product to storage so we're
going to select this last one right here
and when we validate and apply this once
again we get another back order message
since only one of our tambourines is
manufactured and ready to be stored so
we're going to go ahead and create a
back order with that one which will once
again create another back order for the
remaining tambourine all right so right
now at this point I want us to go back
over here to the well back over to ouro
and then we're going to go back over to
our transfers now you'll notice we have
a new one that says waiting for another
operation all right up to this point we
finished the entire manufacturing flow
for one tambourine we've picked the
components assembled the instrument and
mark the manufacturing order as done and
we've transferred the product back to
our stock all that's left to do is
complete the same flow for the second
one however we still don't have enough
components so we're going to need to
order Miller so to do that we actually
have to go out of here and go inside of
our inventory application over here and
then we're going to select operations
replenishment this is where the really
cool thing happens now since I have a
vendor designated on the component's
product forms and the system knows that
I need one more frame six more dowels
and 12 more zills to make the remaining
tambourine Odo actually shows me what I
need for each of these components and I
could do it all at once and isn't that
fabulous all I have to do is click on
order once for each component which will
start to create that purchase order for
me look at that boom we're all done
right there and what's really neat is is
that ODU only creates a single purchase
order for all three components since we
buy them from the same vendor all right
sweet let's go check out our purchase
order so we're going to go out of here
and where are we going OD doers well we
just purchased a bunch of stuff so we're
going into the purchase app and we're
going to go into our latest one over
here now we're going to confirm the
order and I'm going to pretend that I
see everything inside of our warehouse
so we're going to basically we're going
to receive the products and apply this
validating it and applying boom we're
all done awesome now when we go out of
here and back inside of manufacturing to
our work order over here our
manufacturing order sorry o doers we'll
actually see that the component status
is now available and If I click on the
transfer smart button what does it say
as well oo doers that first one that we
were waiting on is now ready since we
have the components on hand so we're
going to go in there and now we're going
to validate the pick we're going to
apply this with the components picked we
can actually complete the manufacturing
order so we're going to go back into
that manufacturing order over here here
we're going to Mark as done we're going
to apply this and we're all done at this
point would you look at that o doers and
when I click on at this point our
transfers look at that it's already
ready now we can validate this and apply
this as well because we've made
everything and finally when we go look
at our tambourines product page what
does it say out doers says we have two
units right there and that's it for this
video today we learn how to use back
orders throughout the entire three-step
manufacturing process process now we can
move forward with any manufacturing
orders that are partially ready even if
we can't manufacture all the products at
once thanks for watching grab a snack
this one was complicated so probably
grab a full
dinner
