what's up o doers and welcome back for
another tutorial like most apps in Odo
the sales and Manufacturing apps are
integrated with one another this allows
for a bunch of cool workflows including
the use of the manufacturing app to fill
a product needed created by the
inventory app here's how it works when a
sales order or so is confirmed for a
product that's not currently available a
manufacturing order ormo is created to
manufacture the product and fulfill that
need the there are two workflows we can
use to make that happen the first uses
the replenish on order route also known
as MTO while the second uses specific
type of reordering rule so let's jump
into our Odo database and see how this
all works all right we're going to start
with the MTO route workflow this route
is archived by default so we need to
unarchive it first to do so I'm going to
hop into the inventory application click
on configuration and then head down to
routes and from here I'll go ahead and
use the drop down in the search bar here
and click the archived in the filter
section
now I just need to tick the checkbox
next to the replenish on order MTO
option click on the actions button here
and then click on unarchived and then
boom the MTO route is ready for use now
let's see the product we'll be selling
and Manufacturing to do that I'll click
on products and then products once again
and simply click on our dresser
product on the products form I need to
make sure the canb sold option here is
ticked and enabled so it can be added to
SOS I also need to click on the
inventory tab here and make sure both
the manufacturer and the MTO options are
enabled the MTO route tells Odo that we
want to replenish the product when
there's a need for it and when we enable
the manufacture route as well ODU knows
that we want to replenish this product
by manufacturing it the only other thing
we need to worry about is the product's
bill of materials or bomb this contains
all the information needed to
manufacture the product now I've already
created one but to do so yourself all
you have to do is click on the build
material smart button and then simply
click on new feel free to also check out
our tutorial on build material basics
for a full overview of bomb
creation all right we're ready to create
a sales order for our dresser and use
the MTO route to manufacture it so now
all we have to do is head over to our
sales application click new to create a
new quotation and we'll go ahead and use
our good friend here Terry Green in the
customer field and then down below on
the order product lines all we have to
do is add our addresser and then to turn
this into an so I'll just go ahead and
click
confirm one side do an emmo is
automatically created to manufacture the
product which I can access by simply
clicking on the manufacturing smart
button this is one of the most useful
features in the MTO route because the
MMO is linked to the so that created it
it also means that the product is
reserved for that specific so and can't
be used for any other now let's go ahead
and click on produce to manufacture this
one unit of this
dresser and next I'll go ahead and head
back to Theo by clicking on the Sal
smart button here at the top then
deliver the product we can click on the
delivery smart button here and to go
ahead and finish this delivery all we
have to do is Click
validate and just like that we've sold
one unit of our dresser manufactured it
and sent it to Mr Green now before we
move on I should mention that the MTO
route always creates anmo for a product
when it is included in an so this is the
case even when there's enough stock on
hand to fulfill the so now let's set
everything up the same but this time
we're going to use the reordering rule
instead of the MTO route so to do so
I'll head back to the dresser by
selecting products products once again
selecting our dresser and then I'm going
to click on the inventory tab again but
untick the MTO option since we won't be
using it of course then I'll go ahead
and click on the reordering rules smart
button here and then click
new in the route field here we're going
to use
manufacturer and since we won't be
replenish this product I'll go ahead and
leave both the minimum set to zero and
maximum set to zero and then for the far
right on the two order I'll go ahead and
put one in that column so how does this
work well we have zero units of the
dresser on hand creating an for it makes
the onand quantity negative since this
is below the minimum quantity of zero
and Manufacturing ORD created to
replenish the product back to the
maximum quantity of zero the product is
replenished in increments of one since
that's what we entered in the two order
column this is called a 001 reordering
Rule and it's just one of the ways
reordering rules can be used for a full
overview make sure to check out our
reordering rules tutorial all right
let's complete another sales order with
this reordering rule workflow so to do
so I'll create another quotation and
select new in
quotations and then we'll add Terry
green once again to the customer field
let's go ahead and add our addresser
once more to the order lines then I'll
click confirm to confirm this into an so
and once I do you'll notice no
manufacturing smart button appears at
the top of this page don't worry though
anmo was generated automatically but in
this case it's not linked to the so this
also means that the product was created
by Theo will not be reserved for thiso
and can be used for any other orders if
necessary so to open the emo I'll head
back to the manufacturing
application select operations and then
down to manufacturing orders and then
simply create click on the most recent
order and then here I'll go ahead and
click produce all to manufacture the
dresser and now all I have to do is
return to the sales
application and click on
ouro and then if I click on the delivery
smart button to open up the delivery
order once the dresser has been shipped
I just need to click validate and then
we're all done and that's it for today
folks you now know the two different
methods used for sales orders to
automatically generate manufacturing
orders thanks for sticking around and
I'll see you next time
