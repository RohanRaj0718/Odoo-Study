hello doers and welcome back today we're
going to discuss how to use the master
production schedule or MPS for my
acronym lovers so that you can pump up
your company's planning capabilities to
the max Master production schedule is a
long-term planning tool that gives you a
bird's eye view of your overall
production it's based on your company's
aggregate plan but requires additional
inputs like the demand forecast
inventory levels and customer orders in
return the master production schedule
provides you with the quantity you need
to produce the remaining inventory and
the overall amount of product you can
promise to customers when set up
correctly the MPS prepares you for
fluctuations in demand so that you can
prevent stockouts perform effective cost
control and plan your company's cash INF
flow MPS is also helpful for dealing
with seasonal products if we use models
to help us forecast Peak demand periods
the MPS can help us plan our
manufacturing taking production capacity
and Lead times into account here at
stealthy wood we also work with seasonal
products like winter holiday decorations
and if you're like me you know it's
never too early to start decorating for
the holidays so enough chitchat let's go
make our house look spooky and very
festive first things first let's quickly
review the bill materials or bomb for
our Christmas painting by going up here
to products Bill materials and selecting
it now I can see that it's made up of a
frame backing board and printed canvas
now that's easy enough
we also need to make sure that we've
activated the master production schedule
Itself by going up to configuration and
settings underneath the planning section
make sure that little checkbox next to
master production schedule is checked
off and save your settings great while
we're here we also have the option to
choose what time range over here that we
want to view in our MPS as well as the
number of columns for now I'm going to
keep the default settings which will
show us 12 months now to go view that
MPS we're going to select planning and
master production schedule great but
it's blank so first you need to add the
products to schedules that you want to
plan out so select add a product let's
go with that Christmas painting again
now we also have the option to select
the build of materials I filled it out
what what happens if you don't if you
leave this field blank the MPS will only
show the product and not the bomb itself
now here I can also Define Safety stock
Target which is the extra inventory we
can keep to prevent a stock out I can
also indicate the minimum and the
maximum values to replenish for now I'm
going to leave these all as they are and
just hit save great stuff has appeared
now and now we can see the forecast for
the painting as well as all of its
components over here now by default the
following fields are displayed we have
the forecaster demand which is the
estimated future demand for a product we
also have the suggested replenishment
which tells us how much of a product we
should order to keep up with demand and
finally we have forecasted stock which
tells us how much inventory we should
keep to keep up with that demand as well
everything right now is zero because we
haven't set up a forecasted Demand yet
for each product I can actually adjust
the Safety stock Target or minimum and
maximum replenishment quantities
whenever I want to all I have to do is
hit this little Target across from
forecasted stock and a popup appears
over here I could adjust it to my liking
but for right now I'm going to hit
cancel on that now clicking on over here
where we have the unequal or less than
sign above it takes us to the same exact
popup so we're going to cancel that out
too now finally if I have a lot of
products visible on the MPS and I want
to view just one of them I can simply
search for it by typing in something
like let's see the frame over here and
boom there it is all right now that
we've reviewed the default settings it's
time to get crazy over here let's add
some of those additional fields to this
bad boy now the way we do that by
clicking on rows that we have right
there and now we can add some of them
now right here we have the actual demand
which is based on confirmed sales orders
so when we check actual demand it'll
show as a fraction of the forecasted
demand value now let's say that I want
to view the last year's actual demand so
we're going to do actual demand y one
over there boom this generates a new row
containing last year's demand and then
over here we have the actual
replenishment that we have right there
and what does that do well it provides
us replenishment values based on
confirms rfqs along with manufacturing
orders so when we have that option there
boom we have it and now it displays as a
fraction of the suggested replenishment
and then finally we have available to
promise over here and that is the
quantity of products we can sell at the
end of a period when we check it look at
that it can be viewed as well as a
fraction of the forecasted stock on the
same page few all right that was a lot
of info I out so why don't we enter
actual values into the MPS and see how
that magic works so the first value
we'll want to Define for each month is
the forecasted demand since the MPS is
based on forecasted and actual demands
and the forecasted demand has to be
entered manually but this is a seasonal
product so we only got to do a couple
months so I'm Loosely going to base my
estimates on last year's actual demand
so starting with no November over here
we had 800 then we had
950 somehow a th000 and finally it goes
down again at 900 a lot of stuff
happened when I did that now you'll
notice that these forecast of demand
values for the final product will affect
the indirect demand forecast for each of
my components so I don't need to
manually forecast everything which is
super handy and in this case the ratio
of each component to the finished
product is 1: one so the demand values
are directly proportional as you could
tell when we have the 800 there and then
each of them is also there great now the
suggested replenishment value that we
have up here has also been populated
automatically and since I don't have any
products or components in stock it's
going to be the same as the forecast of
Demand right above it if I want to
change the adjusted replenishment value
manually I can actually just do that by
changing it in here let's assume that
this was actually
950 oh no would you look at that when I
click away an x button shows up and it
tells me it gives me the option to reset
this to what it actually was in case I
had butter fingers now the available to
promise value is you guessed it also
calculated automatically and it equals
the replenishment minus the actual
demand okay now that we understand what
the MPS values mean and everything let's
move on to replenishment when I hover
the word replenish over here look at
that Odo ODU highlights the earliest
cell that needs replenishment when I
click on replenishment
Boom it applies the actual replenishment
the cell has now turned gray since the
adjusted and actual replenishment values
are equivalent when I hover it again now
this time it's showing me the next
earliest month December this time let's
see what happens when I replenish more
than is required by the demand so we're
going to hit a th000 in here instead of
950 now when I hit
replenish and click on that X would you
look at that the cell turns red since we
replenish more than the originally
suggested quantity now for the next
month let's see what happens when I
replenish less than the suggested
quantity so for this one we're going to
put 900 right there boom look at that o
doers if I click away you'll notice that
my forecasted stock is now negative
relative to the forecasted demand which
means I'm replenishing too little over
hero doers now for the purpose of this
example I'm going to click replenish
anyway on that one and then when we hit
the
X look at that the sell is now yellowy
orange because the actual replenishment
is less than suggested right there all
right one more thing and then we're done
if I want to look at my actual
replenishment documents all I have to do
is click on the Bolen number that
represents the actual replenishment
right there if we click over here we see
we have 800 of these manufacturing
orders and look at that they are all at
this point
confirmed and what does that mean oo
doers well if we go back over here to
the master production schedule I'll talk
about that now the process of
determining and applying replenishment
values for components is the same as the
final product for example let's look at
in our case we have the frame component
that we had over here if we click over
here to the actual replenishment button
and then we select the value in this
case we have 800
rfqs and I'll see that that's because we
purchased the frames instead of
manufacturing them now for this to work
you'll need to have a vendor setup on
the component product form as well so
make sure that you have that and finally
if a component is manufactured instead
of purchased it's replenishment document
will be a manufacturing order but
everything follows the same general flow
of logic these OS and everything as you
guessed it will either be in an RFQ or a
confirm stage in the case of mos and
that's it now you know how to use the
master production schedule and odu's
Manufacturing app now it's time to use
this through your advantage and become a
production scheduling Master anyways as
always OD doers thanks for watching this
one was pretty complex so go grab
yourself a
snack
