welcome back my
alligators wait a second that's supposed
to say allocators I need to talk with my
script writers about that o dupsy
anyways as you may have guessed we're
talking about allocation today you see
when products or components are
manufactured we sometimes want to use
them to prioritize certain sales orders
or manufacturing orders for example
maybe we have a super super important
customer who has just ordered one of our
cabinets we get a lot of cabinet orders
but this customer is so important that
we want to send them the very next
cabinet that we manufacture well by
using the allocation reports feature
inside of the Odus manufacturing app we
can quickly reserve a cabinet from our
next Mo to make sure it gets sent to the
VIP customer and isn't used for a
different order so enough chitchat let's
jump into our database and see how that
works all right the first thing that we
need to do is make sure that allocation
reports are enabled so to do so I need
to head into the manufacturing
application select configuration and
settings so underneath the operations
header over here you want to scroll down
to the very bottom and the check box
next to allocation report for
manufacturing orders should be checked
off I've already done it on my database
so make sure you do the same in yours
and remember what am I going to say here
hit save always save if you haven't done
so already now moving forward let's say
that I've just gotten a call from Jim
Joo Kelly you may remember him from
previous videos that's because he orders
a lot of stuff from us that makes him a
true VIP a very important purchaser as
such we want to make sure that we
prioritize any orders he places with us
so Jim Joe wants to order one of our
cabinets to get started on his order
we're going to head out of here and head
over to the sales application select new
RFQ request for quotation for my non
acronym lovers so for a customer select
Jim Joe Kelly got to make sure he
selected right there and in our order
lines I'm going to select a new cabinet
right there
perfect and then once we're done with
that let's confirm this so that we turn
it into a sales order so with the sales
order confirmed I'm going to click on
the delivery smart button up at the top
over here so inside of the product
availability wow actually the product
availability itself right now it says
it's not available which means we don't
have any cabinets available to fulfill
this order so since we manufacture our
cabinets we're going to need to make one
to send the Jim Joe however we need to
make sure that the first cabinet we make
goes straight to his order and not to
any other this is where an allocation
report comes into play to start let's
head over to the manufacturing app right
there and then what do we want to select
well we need to create create anmo for
10 cabinets which allows us to fulfill
Jim Joe's order and we have to have some
cabinets left over so to do that I'm
going to select operations manufacturing
orders and you guessed it now you want
to select new perfect so from here I'm
going to add the cabinet up at the top
for the product and the C the quantity
right there for the cabinets is 10 as I
said before now I'm going to confirm
this with a big old purple confirm
button so once I confirm the emmo an
allocation smart button appears in the
top Center and in this case the smart
button appears immediately because we
have SOS oros that require one or more
cabinets and there is not enough stock
available to fulfill those orders if
there were enough cabinets available to
fulfill any existing SOS the allocation
smart button would still appear but only
after we complete the ammo by clicking
produce all which is over here on the
left and as you may have guessed if
there are no SOS oros that require the
product being manufactured the
allocation smart button does not appear
at all anyways in this case I'm just
going to click on the produce all at the
top of the ammo just to complete the
manufacturing of our cabinets and make
them available for order f
filment now let's click the allocation
smart button which in this case opens up
the MRP reception report for this MMO
the report lists every open order for
which one or more cabinets are required
this includes our order of one cabinet
for as you guessed it Jim Joe Kelly
right there at the bottom as well as
orders for Abigail Peterson not a VIP
Jacob Johnson also not a VIP you may
notice that all of the orders listed
here are sales orders ERS this is
because our cabinet is a finished
product one that is sold to customers if
we were manufacturing a component like
the wood used to make our cabinets for
example this page would show any
manufacturing orders that require that
component very very cool now like all of
our customers we love Abigail and Jacob
and appreciate that they've decided to
come to us to fulfill their cabinet
needs however we don't love them quite
as much as we love Jim Joe he is quite a
big spender after all so we need to make
sure that one of the cabinets in this
emo was allocated for Jim Joe's order
specifically we wouldn't want to receive
an order for 10 cabinets and have all of
the ones we manufacturing get used for
that order instead of Jim Joe's am I
right right so what I'm going to do is
click on the in our case assign button
to Jim Joe
Kelly and doing so reserves one unit of
the cabinet this means it will appear as
unavailable for other orders even though
we have it in stock I'm sure you notice
that there's also an assign all Button
as you saw over here if we click this it
would assign cabinets to every quantity
required for the order this doesn't
apply to Jim Joe's order since he only
ordered one cabinet however it's useful
for orders like in our case Jacobs where
his order requires one quantity of three
units and another quantity of one unit
as well all right after clicking assign
on Jim Joe's order the button changes to
in our case unassign if we wanted to if
I click this it would unassign the
cabinet from his order and make it
available for others addition Al we also
have the option to print a label to the
extreme right of the order and that can
now be selected as well clicking this
would generate and download a PDF
document with a label that I could print
out to attach to the cabinet to signify
it has been reserved for this specific
order now that we've assigned a cabinet
to jimjo Let's return out of this and
into his delivery order by clicking on
the wh and our case out button over here
next to his sales
order so here we can actually see
product availability now is green this
means the cabinet is available to be
shipped out once we ship it all we need
to do is click on the validate button up
here at the top and we're all
done and that's all I've got for you
today o doers you now know how to use
allocation reports to reserve products
for specific orders thanks for tuning in
and I'm going to see you next time
