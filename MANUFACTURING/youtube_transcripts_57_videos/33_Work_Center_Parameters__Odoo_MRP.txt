what's going on o doers and welcome back
today we're taking a deep dive into work
centers specifically we'll be talking
about how to use a few settings on the
work center form to influence the
expected duration of work orders carried
out at those centers so let's jump into
our database to see how we can provide
ODU with the information it needs to
make those
calculations all right let's start by
opening the form for one of our work
centers I'm going to go ahead and do
that by opening our manufacturing
application selecting configuration at
the top and then down to work centers
and then we're going to click on our
finished station work center which is
used to apply wood finishes to our wood
products now we've already covered the
fields at the top of the form in our
work center Basics video If you haven't
watched that one already be sure to
check it out I'll also leave a link to
it in the description below today we'll
be focusing on a few of the fields in
the general information tab starting
with our production
information first up we have our time
efficiency field the value entered here
represents how efficient the work center
is when it comes to processing work
orders in relation to their expected
duration for example the field currently
shows 100% which means a work order with
an expected duration of 60 Minutes will
take 60 Minutes to process now if I
enter 200% here
instead it means the work center
processes work orders twice as fast so a
work order that normally take 60 Minutes
would only take 30 minutes with this
example let's enter a Time efficiency
value of 50% which means work orders
processes here take twice as long next
we have the capacity Field capacity this
one's a little bit simpler to explain
basically this represents how many units
of a product can be produced at this
work center so if I enter five in the
capacity field here this means this work
center could process five units of a
product at the same
time we'll just leave it set to this
capacity of five for our example for now
up next we have our OE Target which
stands for overall equipment
Effectiveness here we can set a goal for
how efficient we want the work center to
be this is calculated on the expected
duration versus actual duration of work
orders by default this is set to 90%
since we don't usually expect a work
center to be 100% productive but of
course we can adjust it as needed OE is
based on a fairly complicated
calculation that we examine in Greater
detail in our overall equipment eff in
this video so be sure to check that out
for all the ins and outs of oee so
before we move on to the workflow I also
want to point out two Fields here in our
costing information section which is our
setup time as well as cleanup time these
fields represent the amount of time
needed to set up the work center before
processing a work order and how long it
takes to clean up after finishing one
unlike the time efficiency and capacity
Fields these are just flat values that
are added on the total duration of each
work order so let's say it takes 15
minutes to set up as well as 10 minutes
to clean
up and that takes care of all the fields
we need to worry about for this work
center now let's create an emo that
requires this work center to process a
work order and that will allow us to see
how the values we just entered affects
the expected duration of the work order
so I'm going to go ahead and select
operations then manufacturing orders and
then select
new then I'm going to select our bench
product in the product
field and this product requires the
stain operation which is carried out at
our finished station work center under
normal condition it takes 10 minutes to
complete the stain operation and we can
go ahead and see that in the products
bill of materials or bomb if I wanted to
view the bomb I could go ahead and do so
by clicking this right arrow next to the
build materials field however let's just
keep moving on with this workflow now I
want to manufacture a total of 10
benches so we'll go ahead and enter that
in the quantity field and then from here
let's go ahead and click on our work
orders tab to see our stain
operation in the expected duration
column we can see that it takes 65
minutes for this operation for all 10
benches but if it takes 10 minutes for
each bench to be stained and we're
manufacturing 10 benches shouldn't the
number be 100 how did we get to this
number well let's do a little bit of
whiteboard math it takes 10 minutes to
stay in one bench and we're carrying out
the operation for 10 benches that leaves
us with a total number of 100 minutes
however since this work center has a
Time efficiency value of 50% it's going
to take twice as long to complete the
operation which gives us a duration of
200
minutes this work center can also
process five benches at once meaning we
can process a work order in 1 of the
amount of time it would normally take
which leaves us with 40 minutes finally
we have to consider the 15minute setup
time and 10-minute cleanup time after
adding both of these values to our time
of 40 minutes we arrive at our final
value of
65 with those calculations already done
for us all we have to do is confirm Theo
and keep processing and moving on from
there and there you have it OD doward
you now know how to use the fields on a
work center form to properly calculate
the expected duration of work orders now
that you've seen one example I encourage
you to play around with the work center
form by entering different values and
seeing how they interact that's all for
today and I'll see you next time
