good morning my beloved OD doers today
we're talking scrap specifically how to
scrap components and products during and
after the manufacturing process you see
sometimes a component or finished
product can't be used for a variety of
reasons perhaps the vendor sent as a
defective component or maybe a component
or finished product was damaged during
or after manufacturing scrapping a
component or product removes it from our
inventory and places it in a location
designated to store scrap ODU also gives
us the option to replenish the product
quantity that was scrapped allowing us
to get back to manufacturing as quickly
as possible ready to see how this all
works all right let's get
scrapping now the first thing I should
mention is that the scrapping process
works a little differently when using
one-step manufacturing compared to two
or three-step manufacturing let's take a
look at the one-step process first to
begin I need to go to the inventory
application select a configuration and
then our warehouses going to go ahead
and use our main warehouse for this
example and we want to make sure that
manufacturer one step is enabled in our
manufacturer section then I'm going to
click on products products once again
and then select our W and pull
product this is the component used for
our coat rack product and it's the
component that we'll be scrapping as an
example for the first part of this
tutorial under the inventory tab here we
want to make sure that the Buy Route is
selected in the operation section this
is the route that will be used to
replenish the product after we we scrap
it we can always select a different
route if we want to replenish it using a
different method but at least one route
needs to be selected in order to use
replenishment since we've enabled the
Buy Route we need to click on the
purchase Tab and we need to make sure
that a vendor has been added as well as
the price that they sell this product
for perfect looks like we're all set
there last thing I want to point out is
that we only have one unit of our wooden
pull in stock this will come into play
shortly with all of our settings the way
we want them I'm going to jump over to
to our manufacturing application and
create a new emmo by clicking on
operations manufacturing orders and then
new I'll go ahead and select our coat
rack and then confirm
Theo now let's say that the wooden pull
component I pulled from the inventory
has a big crack in it that won't make
for a very sturdy coat rack now will it
so I'm going to click on the scrap
button here at the top of the page and
then the scrap products popup window
will appear in the window I'll start by
clicking the product drop down menu
notice how the only products that can be
selected are the two components used to
manufacture the finished product not the
finished product itself remember that
because we'll come back to it later for
now I'll just select the wooden pull
product in the product field and I'll
leave the quantity field set to one
since that's the amount I'm scrapping
I'm also going to enable the replenish
quantities check boox since I want to
get a new unit of the wooden Pole to
continue with the ml finally I'll scrap
a product prodcts by clicking the scrap
products
button and once we do a few things
happen first in the chatter Theo status
changes from ready to waiting since
we're missing the wooden pull
component also the component status
field now reads not available since the
component is not in stock we also have
two new smart buttons at the top of the
page the first one is titled scraps
which shows us all the scrap orders
created for this ML and the second smart
button is titled purchases which shows
us the purchase orders that were created
to replenish the wooden pull product
you're going to confirm the product
purchase order by clicking on the smart
button clicking confirm then receive
products followed by a validate to enter
the new component into the inventory
when I return to the emmo by using the
breadcrumbs
here the component status now reads
available and at the status of the emo
in the chatter changed back from waiting
to ready
I'm now able to manufacture the coat
rack at which point I'll click on
produce all to complete the MMO very
cool now I should mention that this
process is a bit different if there are
more components in stock in that case
when a component is scrapped The emmo
Remains ready and the component status
still reads available no purchase order
is created as the user is expected to
Simply take the scrapped quantity from
the existing inventory now before we
leave this page I want to use this
completed emmo to show you one more
thing remember how when we were only
able to select the components in the
product field on the scrap orders pop-up
window well now the product has been
manufactured if we click the scrap
button once again the product field here
will allow us to scrap the finished
product I'll select the coat rack enable
replenish quantities and then
scrap since the coat rack uses a
manufacturer route a new emmo has been
created to replace the unit of the
product which we can see by going to
operations manufacturing orders and then
clicking the most recently created
MMO all right before we finish today I
just want to show you the scrapping
process one using two or three-step
manufacturing it's fairly similar but
different enough that it's worth taking
a look at we'll start by returning back
to the inventory application clicking
configuration warehouses and then
selecting our main Warehouse once again
this time we'll select the pick
components then manufacture twep option
in our manufacturer
section then we'll return to the
manufacturing
app to create another MMO for our coffee
table and just like last time we're
going to go to operations manufacturing
orders and we'll select new and we'll
add coffee
table you'll notice that once we confirm
the order Theo status in the chatter
appears as
waiting another operation this is
because two and three-step Manufacturing
require components to be transferred to
the production location before Theo is
marked as ready with that in mind I'll
click the transfer smart button at the
top of the page to open the pick
component's
transfer and then I'll simply go ahead
and select validate to process
it when I return to
Theo the status is now ready in the
chatter all right let's say that the
table tabletop component that we pick
has a large scratch on top of it I'll
scrap it the same way as before by
clicking on scrap and selecting TBL toop
in the drop- down
field once we do enabling the
replenished quantities check box here
and then clicking scrap
products once I do Theo status changes
to waiting back here in the chatter just
like in our previous example however
unlike onstep manufacturing no purchase
order is created to replenish the scrap
quantities instead a new picking order
has been created to transfer the
replacement tabletop to the production
location which I can access by clicking
on the transfer smart button at the top
of the page and selecting the pick
component transfer marked as ready I'll
transfer this by clicking validate and
return to the emo by the breadcrumbs
once
again where I can go ahead and see that
Theo status appears as ready and
available and that's how you replenish
scrap quantities using two or three-step
manufacturing now in the case we were
able to process the replenishment
picking transfer right away since we
were had an extra tabletop in stock
however if there were no extra tabletops
we would need to manually create an
order to replenish them before
validating the pick a purchase order if
they were bought or a manufacturing
order if they are manufactured and that
my dear oders brings us to the end of
another great tutorial today I showed
you how to scrap components and finish
products from a Manufacturing orders and
how to replenish the quantities that
were scrapped that's all for today and
I'll see you next time
