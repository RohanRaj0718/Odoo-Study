hello doers my name is Jose Ignacio and
welcome back I'm here at stealthy wood
our business is expanding especially in
the morning now our manufacturers are
eager to build products and the
procurement team has to make sure they
have everything they need for the day so
today we'll discuss replenishment
methods now since there's so much to do
how can we reduce all of the tedious and
time-consuming tasks that surround
procurement one side of odoo we use a
specific method for automatic reordering
which we call reordering rules now in
manufacturing we want to ensure our
components are in stock to avoid
unnecessary production delays we can
skip having to manually check which
components are running low and instead
use reordering rules to automatically
create purchase orders ah it's beautiful
now when you set up reordering rules Odo
performs a series of procurement
operations automatically based on the
logic you give it for the product or the
groups of products now how it works is
when inventory levels drop beneath a
certain threshold odoo automatically
creates a request for quotations or rfqs
for my acronym lovers now odoo also lets
you use reordering rules to automate the
creation of manufacturing orders from a
sales order I'll explain how to
configure this at the end of the video
as well so enough Chit Chat let's hop
into our stealthy Wood Database
all right I'll do is let's start by
setting up reordering rules for a wood
panel component now first let's take a
look at the bill of materials for the
wood panel so we're gonna head into
manufacturing app products bill of
materials wood panel now we can see that
the wood panel consists of three ply
layers and a wear layer now we
manufacture a lot of wood panels at
stealthy wood so I want to automate the
ordering process for its components
using reordering rules now I can set up
reordering rules directly on the product
itself and in our case I already
configured a reordering rule for my wear
layer so we're all good right there but
let's see one setup for my ply layer so
I'm actually going to go into the ply
layer product form by clicking right
onto it through this little direct link
an important thing to know here before I
set up any actual reordering rules I
need to designate a vendor on the
purchase tab of the product template now
since we need to let odoo know who to
purchase from it's very helpful and
required so in our case once they are
there you can actually see that I have a
few vendors already set up and I can add
more if I wanted to and if I want I can
also change the order by clicking and
dragging them up and down now
another thing to keep in mind the order
of these vendors actually matters with
reordering rules odor will automatically
create requests for quotations to the
vendor placed at the top of the list in
our case wood corner now that we know at
least one vendor is selected and listed
let's go ahead and set up our reordering
rule so we're going to select our smart
button and go right in there now here I
can set a minimum and maximum quantities
these values tell ODU how much of a
component we want to keep in stock and
when to create a request for quotation
so in our case we're going to do 10 and
100 and this looks good now I also want
to note that you can view and create
reordering rules in the inventory app
under the configuration menu instead of
just going through the product form now
this is helpful for keeping track of all
of the reordering rules that are set up
since they can be seen and managed in
one place all right up next let's see
what happens when we create an ammo 4r
wood panel so we're going to go back
into our manufacturing app operations
menu manufacturing orders new one follow
me here and we're going to do this wood
panel and we're gonna confirm it now
what just happened with yours well odoo
lets us know when the components are
unavailable with these red not available
there we go beautiful little doers you
can see what oh dear is that the
quantity ordered reflects the maximum
quantity we set on our reordering rules
while also talking sorry about that
taking the manufacturing orders demand
into account now we want to have what we
wanted to have a hundred pieces in stock
of each component but we use three ply
layers and one wear layer in our current
manufacturing order so what did ODU do
it ordered 103 and 101 because math oh
doers now while Odo automatically
generates an RFQ for us we still have to
manually confirm the order receive the
products into our inventory and also
validate it now for the purposes of this
video in our case we're going to go
ahead and do that since we have the
fastest vendors and procurement team in
town
grillio doers they're lightning fast in
fact they just confirm it receive it and
validate it and we're going to follow
this Dutch crunch breadcrumbs back to
the ammo and look at that we have enough
raw materials now outdoers beautiful
okay
now I want to show you a Nifty trick
using reordering rules we just saw how
we can use reordering rules to
automatically generate purchase orders
but we can also use them to create
manufacturing orders whenever customers
buy products that we manufacture
in-house there are a couple of different
ways to automatically generate
manufacturing orders from a sales order
in odoo now one is by using the MTO
route for manufacturer of our products
now I cover this in a separate video my
MTO video and I invite you to check it
out if you haven't already now we can
also accomplish this same outcome by
sending a reordering rule with both the
minimum and Max set to zero now I'll use
our table product as an example of how
to do that this time I'll set up the
reordering rules from the inventory app
so we're going to go into inventory
and what are we going to do there as
well we're gonna go and look at our
products in this case we're going to go
into configuration and reordering rules
now I'll create a new rule for my
product the table and Define both the
Min and maximum as I talked about as a
solid zero now I'll double check that
the manufacturer route is activated on
my tables basic product form and look at
that it is
now let's create a sales order because
we need to see how this works in action
so we'll hop over to the sales
application and make a new quotation so
while we're here we'll do that and let's
say our customer as our interior wants
to buy one table we'll confirm this
quotation turning it into a sales order
now when we head over to the
manufacturing app
and this time view our manufacturing
orders we'll see a new ammo connected to
our sales order was automatically
created and look at that if we check it
and look at this miscellaneous tab Boom
the source document States what it
states op and that stands for order
point which indicates that this Mo was
created as an inventory replenishment
using reordering rules since I didn't
set up any work orders for this product
all that's left to do is to mark this Mo
as done and then you basically just hit
apply now we can go back to our sales
order using over here into the sales app
and
process the delivery and then in this
case we'll finally hit validate and then
apply the done quantities thus
completing the delivery and the sales
flow and boom there we have it oh doers
what a hot fast day now we know how to
use reordering rules to automate the
procurement process to ensure that we
always have parts available for
manufacturing we also reviewed how you
know reordering rules set to zero to
link over to sales order and into
manufacturing orders as well oh my God
we went through so many things now this
reordering trick over here is also
useful for managing sub assemblies for
products with multi-level bombs I know
you can use oda's reordering rules to
your company's advantage and as always
I'll see you in the next video go grab a
snack
