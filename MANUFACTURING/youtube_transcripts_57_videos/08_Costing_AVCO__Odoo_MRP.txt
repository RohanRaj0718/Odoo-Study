ERS welcome back my name is Jose Ignacio
now in this episode on our costing
method series we'll be focusing on the
average costing method which is avco for
my acronym lovers now this is for
valuing the cost of our manufactured
products now if you missed our costing
overview make sure to check out the key
Concepts I covered before continuing now
for those who already watched the
costing overview well let's ask what
exactly is average costing now this is
important to remember but average
costing is a method that calculates cost
by averaging the prices of purchased
products that are already in stock now
it Updates this value whenever new
products are received or manufactured
now this approach is pretty useful when
the prices of products and their
components tend to change or you Source
them from multiple vendors and that type
of thing in this video I'll be creating
two manufacturing orders for tables
using differently price components to
illustrate how the average cost method
determines the product cost so without
further Ado let's get to our database
all right oh doers so to track the cost
of manufactured products we'll Begin by
setting a cost on our work center to
reflect hourly labor and Machinery costs
so inside of the manufacturing app make
your way over to assembly line one work
center and under the costing information
heading do you see this cost per hour
field well as you guessed here we have
it set to fifty dollars since I pay
Steve quite well to build tables lucky
Steve he has a job okay next let's move
on to the component cost so in order to
check that out we're gonna hop on over
here into the inventory app now we can
see the overview report for our final
product which is the table now to get
there navigate to its product page from
here we go up the products products
table
all right now once that we're here in
the products general information tab you
see this cost per units right now it's
currently set to zero now for more
different information or detailed
information we can actually just click
on the build a material smart button and
when we click on our product
and then the overview smart button boom
we have a report now what does this
report give us well it provides
information on the number of products
that currently can be produced along
with the cost now by checking the
materials I need to make this table over
here via the quantity and everything
what does that tell us well I see that
all the required parts are in stock and
that's a very good thing and that means
that I can basically produce one table
right now and that also means that
inside of the bomb cost column we could
see the cost of production for all of
this as well now as you could tell
that's the work center cost we set up
earlier
beautiful now if you check over here too
the product cost column over here tells
us how much it costs to buy all of the
raw materials as well and that's kind of
important now for the first
manufacturing order I'll be building a
table using a 10 table top and four of
those beautiful legs now before moving
on let's remember
you know this costs what thirty dollars
because 10 and then 20 and that's 30.
all right using that photographic memory
let's create our first manufacturing
order now since you've definitely
watched my manufacturing and one step
tutorial video before I'm going to use a
ammo I created in advance so in our case
make our way over there to our
operations manufacturing order and
select it perfect now once that this
ammo is confirmed I can start the work
order over here by going over to the
work orders tab now I'll say that I
spent 60 Minutes working on this table
like a very hard worker now I can
complete the manufacturing order marking
it as done and applying it and when we
check the table's product form and this
is where it's very cool because all the
magic comes together we see that the
cost is automatically adjusted from zero
to 80 which is a very large jump now
that's really cool but wait there's more
let's see what happens to the product
cost when I process a second
manufacturing order because this is a
very cool thing now this time using more
expensive components so we're going to
go back to our manufacturing orders via
the breadcrumbs which today are
sourdough
and we're going to create a new one all
right now after I confirm this Mo red
icons under reserved indicate that I
don't have enough components but that's
not a problem for stealthy wood I can
refresh my components quickly because I
set up zero zero reordering rules again
if you don't know what that is be sure
to watch my replenishment tutorial but
you already saw that right oh doers all
right so in our case we're gonna go to
the inventory app operations
replenishment and now since the
manufacturing order is confirmed we can
actually see the components appear on
the replenishment page reminding us two
replenishment now if we order four more
table eggs and one more tabletop we're
pretty much all set up now this creates
a RFQ for my acronym lovers and this
basically tells us that I can process it
in the purchase app so let's go do that
now so we're gonna go to the purchase
app select it I hear everyone's excited
about DIY furniture these days so our
vendor raise their prices to double
economy and whatnot per usual now we'll
confirm this order and receive the parts
so that we can make our table beautiful
now after ordering the more expensive
components the product cost on a
components form is automatically updated
again from five to ten dollars now the
cost is determined by the average price
of table legs in stock now since the
five dollar table legs were consumed
well that only leaves us with a ten
dollar ones boom now
that's what I've been talking about oh
doers and I'm going to show you another
neat trick right now all right so now if
we make our way back over here to the
manufacturing app and going into our
Mo's from the operations we've basically
received the parts and I can see that
the component status is available
because of this nice little green status
change now to switch things up we're
going to tackle this order as if we were
the assembler so we're going to go back
to the manufacturing overview and I see
we have a work order ready to launch at
our workstation assembly line one so
let's select that and it's time to do
this so we're going to click ready and
there we have it now when we want to
begin assembling our table we simply go
here and to log our completed work we
simply enter the number of units built
which in our case is one and then we
select Mark is done and I want to make a
quick note that while you cannot adjust
the time spent on the workstation here
we can still change it on the
manufacturing order so if we select the
green back arrow over here go back into
operations and into the menu
manufacturing orders although the
Builder finished the assembly the mo
status is still as to close which is
kind of interesting since this means the
ammo requires a verification before it
is completely marked as done now inside
of the Mo's work orders tab you can
manually change the real duration to 60
Minutes in our case right here perfect
oh doers now I want to make a quick side
note on the components tab there's no
need to manually fill in the amount of
components used or quantity of produced
tables because updates are automatically
pulled from where oh doers from the
workstation but we still need to Mark
the ammo as done so checking the cost
analysis report over here that's
available after closing the ammo as well
odoers we're going to be able to see
that the table manufactured with pricey
components cost a total of 110
ouch that is a lot of dollars basically
right there now when we check back at
the table's product form over here
I see that the product cost has been
updated to 95 now how did odoo come up
with this number and that's kind of the
interesting thing well this is very
important the first table cost eighty
dollars to make and the second table
cost 110 now you divide the sum of the
cost by two to get the average cost of
95. odoo did the math for us friends so
we don't have to it's also important
hero doers the average cost is updated
automatically every time an MO is
processed now this feature also applies
to components which I also have
categorized under average cost and there
you have it that's how you know how to
evaluate the average cost of
manufactured products for more
information on the standard price and
fifo costing methods in this case be
sure to check out the next two videos
now see you next time oh doers go grab a
snack
