what's up OD doers and welcome back
today I'm going to show you how to
consume components with odu's barcode
app no I'm not talking about eating food
I'm talking about manufacturing Goods
we'll see how to consume both tracked
and untracked components how to consume
multiple components at once and how to
add or scrap components on a day's work
am I right the barcode app helps
expedite the manufacturing process by
making it more more handsfree imagine if
you're assembling a product that had
five or more parts and each time you had
to go register a component at a computer
sounds like a lot of tedious work
luckily with Odo you can scan these
components as you go without even having
to leave the shop floor so let's see how
to do this in
Odo okay first things first we need to
enable one setting for our Barcode
Scanner so let's click into the settings
application and we're just going to
select the inventory app on the left
side of our navigation bar
in this section we just want to scroll
down to our Barcode Scanner and make
sure that that option is enabled looks
good another important step is making
sure that product barcodes are actually
set up on each component that needs to
be scanned when I click on this
configure barcodes button right here I
can see a list of all of our products
with their respective barcodes as well
as their IDs assigned so these barcodes
are found on product labels they can be
printed or stuck onto products
so now we need to have a manufacturing
order or ano we'll open that in the
barcode app today we're going to be
making someone star Piñata since they're
having a fiesta tonight so let's go back
to the ODU dashboard and we're just
going to click into the barcode app and
there are a few different ways we can
open orders in the barcode app which are
covered in our tutorial on processing OS
but for now we're just going to use our
Barcode Scanner right
here and scan the printed Mo slip that
we have for our star pinata which looks
like this right
here nice so we can see all Theo details
now on the star Pata and here we see the
components needed to build it like
cardboard colored paper and we even have
some of the fillings that go within this
Pata so one thing to not ODU lets us
record the consumption of all these
products in one swoop all I have to do
is use the barcode scanner to scan the
finished product which is our
pinata and now all the components are
populated and we can just click produce
all and then we'll get a confirmation
that this MMO has been
validated okay so now I'm going to show
you how to consume components
individually so I'm just going to scan
the emmo for my rainbow Pata
and I'll see all the components needed
to make it many of these components can
be consumed without worrying about
tracking for example we have our string
right
here so it doesn't really matter which
specific string is glued to hold the top
of the pinata up but there are three
ways to record these untracked
components as consumed in the barcode
app first if I wanted to see the
detailed line item of the string I could
click on this pencil icon right here
and here I can manually type in the
product
quantity and this is especially useful
when there are large quantities being
consumed or another thing I can do is
Click any of these buttons right here to
update the quantity accordingly in many
cases though that method may be overly
meticulous so let's head back to
Theo the second way to consume a
component is by clicking this plus one
button right here and if there were
let's say five strings needed to make
this Piñata then this button would say
plus five and let me consume all five at
once third way to consume an untracked
component is you guessed it scanning the
barcodes product as we know those
barcodes are found on the product form
so all you have to do is simply scan the
product
barcode and ODU will register the
component as consumed it's extremely
easy now for components tracked by lot
or serial numbers I'll need to input it
directly
similar to untrack components I can do
this three different ways so if we
scroll up here to our gummy
candy I see that there's supposed to be
30 gummies in this Piata you might also
notice there's a barcode icon as well as
a lot number and this is the lot that is
reserved for this component to be picked
from so a documentation on picking from
reserved Lots or seal numbers for more
information so one thing I could do is
click this plus one or plus 30 button
right there to consume all of it without
checking a lot or serial number data but
I want to see more details so instead
I'm going to click this pencil icon
right
here and here I can see that there are
multiple lots of gummies in stock all
with varying quantities on hand in each
one in this serial number lot field I
can specify which lot I want to pick
from in this case we're okay with taking
these from the first available lot so
I'm just going to leave this as is and
pick from gummy
O3 our pinata needs 30 gummies so I'll
type 30 into this field right
here and now I'll click
confirm and boom we've officially
consumed 30 gummies I mean I mean I
haven't eaten 30 gummies but they're for
the pinata party of
course anyway there's one more way we
could track consumed components and you
guessed it it's through the barcode
scanner I could scan the component's
barcode but it's recommended to scan the
barcode of the lot instead and that's so
Odo knows the specific lot I want to
pull this component from so let's scan
our other tra component our chocolate
gummies and there we go our chocolates
have been consumed
now let's say we accidentally squished
three chocolates while producing this
order H Agony we could scrap this
component two different ways the first
way is I could scan the scrap command
barcode from Odo or I can also click the
gear icon up here and then choose
scrap in the product search I'm just
going to type in chocolate
candies and select
it and we've lost three chocolates so
I'm going to change the quantity
here to
three I can also choose which lot the
candy came from and I'm just going to
choose the third one right
there and I'm ready to click
scrap sometimes ODU might ask you to
confirm that you want to scrap the
material so just make sure to click
confirm if that happens now if I click
into the pencil icon next to the
chocolate candies
I can see that the onhand quantity in
lot 3 has depleted by three chocolates
it's a sad
day now what if I want to make this
rainbow Pata extra special by adding
components that maybe weren't originally
part of the build materials like for
example we have purple paper that I
decided I wanted to add so if we go back
to the
MMO and click add component
all I have to do is scan the product
barcode there or if I click
back I could just scan the purple
barcode which I will do right
now and when I do it just adds it to the
current Mo great so it looks like we
have some components registered as
consumed but not all of them aside from
scanning the finished products barcode
another way to quickly consume all
components at once is simply by clicking
the plus one button right here for
rainbow
Pata when we do all components have been
recorded as consumed so I can just click
produce
all and from here we have our
consumption warning since we added some
purple paper to this ml so we'll just
click
confirm and the manufacturing order has
been manufactured it's time to party
and today we covered a lot about
consuming components in odo's barcode
app thanks for learning with me and I'll
see you in the next video
